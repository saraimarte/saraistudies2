# Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Forecasting:** Estimating demand.  
**Demand Planning:** Planning so that you can meet the demand you forecasted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Forecasting

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Notes on Demand 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Independent Demand:** demand that is unrelated to the demand of other items. Demand is forecasted (Toothpaste).  
**Dependent Demand:** demand that depends on the demand for other items. Demand is calculated (Tube, Cap).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Most products are made up of different components.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For example, toothpaste is made up of different components like the tube and the cap.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The toothpaste is an independent demand item.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

While the cap and the tube itself are dependent demand items because their demand depends on if the toothpaste company needs them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As in, your company will only demand the tubes and caps *if* they need them to make their toothpaste.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Which is why the demand for tubes and caps *depends* on demand for toothpaste. Hence, they are dependent demand items.

## Forecasting Techniques 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When to use each and what it's based on...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Qualitative:** Use when we have a product with no or limited data for it yet (like for new products). Based on opinion and intuition.  
**Quantitative:** Use when we have data. Based on...data (products that have been in the market already).  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Qualitative Models

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) **Personal Insight:** forecast is based on the most experienced person available.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(2) **Jury of Executive Opinion:** forecast is based on the group of people who know most about the product (like a management group).   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(3) **Delphi Method:** Same as the Jury of Executive Opinion but here, input of each person is collected separately so there is no influence from others.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(4) **Sales Force Estimation Method:** Same as the Jury of Executive Opinion but here, the group is specifically sales people.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(5) **Customer Survey:** forcast is based on customer's opinion.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Quantitative Models

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We have to categories of Quantitative techniques:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Time Series**: Where we use past data to predict the future.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) **Naive:** forecasts the demand for the next period to be the same as the actual demand in the last period. Works better with mature products where demand is easily predictable. (Ex. If we sell 250 cartons of milk this period, we will estimate we will sell 250 cartons of milk in the next period.)  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(2) **Simple Moving Average:** forecasts the demand for the next period to be the average of the actual demands in the last x amount of periods. More accurate. But fails to identify trends.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(3) **Weighted Moving Average:** same as simple moving average but you're giving every demand from x amount of periods a weight in importance aka the last period's demand may be worth more. This helps identify trends.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(4) **Exponential Smoothing:** forecasts the demand for the next period to be based on a formula (D x S) + (F x (1-S)). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Where **D** = last period's actual demand **S** = smoothing factor (given in this class) **F** = last period's <s>estimate</s> forecast of demand.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(5) **Linear Trend:** forecasts the demand for the next period to be based on a linear graph that predicts the future. Fails to be affected by seasonal and cyclical variations.        

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Cause and Effect**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) **Simple Regression:**  forecasts demand based on a line that best models the relationship betweenn a single independent variable an a dependent variable. (Ex. **Indep.Var** = Weather **Dep.Var** = Demand for Icecream. The graph will show that when the Weather is hot the demand for icecream will be high.)   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(2) **Multiple Regression:**  same as simple linear Regression but there is more than 1 independent variable so maybe weather and income levels may affect demand for icecream.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Forecasting error

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We learned methods on how to forecast demand but 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

forecasting is just an estimate. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Hence, it will never be 100% accurate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Our forecast will have error. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The goal is to minimize that error.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Error (value) = A - F

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Error (%) = [ |(A - F)| / A ] x 100

<Note>

Where, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A = Actual Demand   
F = Forecasted Demand  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We also denote the forecast error as e<sub>t</sub>. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Where, t = time period. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ex. e<sub>2</sub> means the forecast error for the second month, week, etc. )

</Note>

The way to minimize the error is to analyze it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

## Measures of Forecasting Accuracy 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Aka: methods to test how accurate our errors are.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Where, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A = Actual Demand  
F = Forecasted Demand      
n = Number of time periods  
∑ = "sum of" or "add up"  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**(1) Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)**: MAD = ∑(|A – F|) / n. The average of the errors for n amount of periods. Interpretation Given MAD = 115: "I miss the forecast by an average of [115] (either up or down)" OR "For my forecast, i'm always wrong by [115]"  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**(2) Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE)**: ∑ ((|A – F|)/ A) / n. MAPE is MAD but as a percentage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**(3) Mean squared error (MSE):** MAD = ∑(|A – F|)<sup>2</sup> / n. Same thing as MAD but we square the errors before dividing by n. Squaring is just another way of making the erros absolute.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Forecast Bias

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Not only can we measure error, we can measure bias!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Forecast Bias:** when demand is consistently either over or under forecasted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There is also a formula: ∑ Error = ∑ A– ∑ F

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If ∑ Error ≠ 0 then there is bias. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Underestimating Demand : ∑ Error < 0. 
Overestimating Demand: ∑ Error > 0.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Bias is a problem just like error is so we have to measure bias. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Methods to Measure Forecast Bias 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**(1) Running Sum of Forecast Errors (RSFE)** = ∑ e<sub>t</sub> (t = time period. Ex. e<sub>2</sub> means the forecast error for the second month, week, etc. )

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Positive RSFE: means forecasts are too low. Underestimating Actual Demand.  
Negative RSFE: means forecasts are too high. Overestimating Actual Demand.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

we are being too positive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

if positive result means actual demand was greater than forecast so we should we have been low balling we should be more optomistic.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Running Sum of errors was skipped.

# The Bullwhip Effect 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Problem: The Bullwhip Effect**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is what happens when a group of customers may all of a sudden buy more (or less) of a product. Let's say 10% more. So, the retailer detects that and notices the demand is going up for this product so they want to take advantage of this and they will order more from their distributor, 25% more than what they usually order. The distributor sees that same thing and they want to take advantage of that and order more from the factory/the manufacturing company (us). Let's say 30% more. And then the factory sees that and wants to take advantage of that and order more, let's say 40% more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is an issue because of lack of communication. They all guessed how much the demand was increasing, it ended up being 40% more when really demand increased by 10%. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you whip a bullwhip, it amplifies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Solution: CPFR**  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img1.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Specifically, Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, & Replensishment (CPFR)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Customers and Suppliers share their plans, forecasts and delivery schedules with one another.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That way, they are not left guessing what's happening. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
