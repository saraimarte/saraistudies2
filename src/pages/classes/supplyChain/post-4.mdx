# Inventory 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Key Question: How much inventory to keep on hand?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Inventory: quantities and materials held in stock.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For accountants: Inventory is an asset- something you own and may be able to sell.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For manufactures: Inventory may become a liability (Ex. if you have too much inventory, you need space to store it so if you run out of space you may need to rent extra space.)  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## 4 Categories of Inventory (aka the inventory system from managerial accounting yayy)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) Raw Materials  
(2) Work in *process* (WIP)  
(3) Finished Goods   
(4) Maintenance, Repair and Operating Supplies (MROs) (oil you put in machine that makes the products, you need inventory of that oil or paper you need in the office, you need to keep inventory of the paper aka indirect materials)  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### (1) Raw Materials 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

How much raw material should a company keep in hand?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Some companies decide to buy the raw materials so it comes just in time. Others, buy more than they need to.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### (2) Work In Process

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Products that are in the *process* of being made. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Maybe you make chairs and the chair is missing a leg- then that chair is considered to be a work in *process* because it's currently in the *process* of being made.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### (3) Finished Goods 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Make-to-Order Company: Plane Manufactures. The plane companies don't just have planes laying around. When the planes are ordered then they are made.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Make-to-Stock Company: Crayola Crayons. Crayola has stock of their crayons. They make to stock.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Inventory in the Service Industry

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You can't have inventory of services- you have to actually perform the services.  
It does, however, have inventory of facilitating goods used to perform the service.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Functions of Inventory

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## (1) Cycle Stock

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We have just enough stock/inventory to meet demand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## (2) Safety Stock

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We have more than enough stock/inventory to meet unceretainties in sales or shortages or delays.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## (3) Strategic Stock

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## (4) Decouple Depedencies in the Supply Chain

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Inventory Management

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The goal of inventory management:  more profits while decreasing COGS and/or increasing sales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# 3 Levels of Inventory Stock

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) Strategic Stock  
(2) Safety Stock   
(3) Cycle Stock

# Inventory Policy 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When we define how much inventory how much we're going to have.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Answer the 3 questions: 

## (1) When do we review how much inventory we have so we can decide what to do?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

-We continually look at how much we have. Having a computer system that tracks how much of DM, WIP and FG, and even MRO's. Good: Accurate. Bad: Expensive.  

-We periodically review. Good: Save time. Less Expensive. Bad: May not be as accurate.

## (2) When to order? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When the inventory level reaches the Reorder Point Line (ROP).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

ROP = dL = (demand per day) * (number of days it takes for order to arrive)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

ROP without safety stock

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Everything needs to be perfect. If you get more demand then you're in trouble.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

ROP with safety stock- to account for suppliers delays. If they take more time to deliver the stock.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is more flexible.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

ROP with safety stock then ROP = ROP + Safety Stock.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is easier *with* a continuous review then a periodic review.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## (3) How much to order?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We have been saying we're ordering a month's worth of stock but how do we determine that?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What's the optimal amount you need to order? It has deal with costs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The amount you need to order is the amount that is most cost efficient.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Fixed-Order system

### The Economic Order Quantity Model (EOQ)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Order Costs: The cost of placing the order (preperation, transportation, receipt processing, materials handling/shipping costs)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Carrying Costs: The costs you have for holding, *carrying* inventory (taxes, insurance, storage costs)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Determine the amount of stock to order that minimized both of these costs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Total Cost = Purchase Cost + Order Cost + Carrying Cost

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In the graph- the point where the order and carrying cost intersect- is minimum cost.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(Calcualtion of EOQ is not on the test, you just need to know that it's the fixed order amount you want to place because that's where the costs are minimized)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Fixed-Time System, ABC, Base Stock Level and Single Period  You dont need to know.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Bin System - you have 2 bins. You take inventory from 1st bin and once you run out of inventory, you take from the 2nd bin and the amount of time it takes for the 2nd bin to go is the amount of time that it takes for the first bin to fill up again.
The one after bin.
