We have a demand plan. Now we need to see what we can do to satisfy that demand plan.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The goal is to balance supply and demand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We want to supply enough to meet the demand. No more, no less. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: If we supply too much food, and people are not demanding it, then the food goes bad and that's a loss.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Supply Chain Planning 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Is a combination of all planning processes used in the supply chain like 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) Aggregate Production Plan (APP)  
(2) Master Production Scheduling (MPS)  
(3) Materials Requirement Planning (MRP)  
(4) Distribution Requirements Planning (DRP)  
(5) Capacity Planning  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Supply chain planning can be divided into 3 categories.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Long-Range: We plan for the big things like the purchasing of major equipment we need for the plan (1 year) (R&D, Facility Expansion)(APP) Involved: Executives.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**2.** Intermediate-Range: We plan for the middle things like how many products are we going to make for the next 3-18 months (Sales planning, Production Planning)(MPS) Involved: Mid-level Management workers.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**3.** Short-Range: We plan for the detailed things like the materials we need for a product (Job assignments, job scheudling, dispatching)(MRP) Involved: In-line supervisors.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Long Range 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In the long range, we have the **business planning.** The business plan focuses on the company's direction and goals for the next 2 to 10 years. The business plan is revaluated annually.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We also have Aggregate Production Plan where the sales and operations planning (S&OP) happens. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

S&OP is a statement plan for the intermediate term. This is revised monthly.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In the Aggregate production plan: establish production rates- literally just list how much of each item you want to produce in each month.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Goals: Meet demand, use capacity efficiently, etc.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### What happens if you produced more or less than people are demanding?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What can companies do to manage that?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

They can influence the demand by, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Advertising (Advertise the supply so more people would want to buy it.)   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**3.** Pricing (lower the price of the supply so more people will demand it.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4.** Allow backordering (pre-ordering)- where people can pre-order the supply. Then, when the company has supply to meet the demand they will send the supply.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**5.** Seasonal Product Mixing (Sell Swimsuits in the summer and shirts in the winter).   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### What if supply is too much or too little?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** We can influence inventory levels- make more supply in advance of demand in order to have it ready.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**2.** Change capacity- either hire or layoff employees, do subcontracting, use part-time workers.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: We skip time fencing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

After the aggregate (total) plan, we move on to the the master production schedule (MPS).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Intermediate-Range 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Master Production schedule (MPS)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This lists the exact products that need to be produced by a specific period. It's just APP but more detailed.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Basic Production Strategies 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These are strategies regarding the workforce during production.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Level Production Strategy: Firms will keep their number of workers constant because no matter the demand, they rely on the fact that they will produce the same because they're counting on the fact that they have backlog (extra inventory). This works well for made to stock companies because they have a lot of products in stock already.     
**2.** Chase Production Strategy: Firms will either hire or layoff workers depending on demand.  This works well for made to order companies like airplane companies because if they have no one demanding planes then no need for workers so they lay them off.    
**3.** Mixed Production Strategy: Firms maintain stable workforce while using overtime and contractors. This works well for construction companies or retail stores during the holiday season.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### The Bill of Materials (BOM)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Single Level Bill of Materials 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It's just a list of components that a simple product needs (like a table- it just has top and 4 legs). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Multiple Level Bill of Materials 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It's just a list of components that a complex product needs (like a car- it has multiple levels, multiple parts that require other parts). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Material Requirements Planning (MRP)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

MRP is a computer management system that tells you the exact quantities, dates, and order of releases for materials required and component parts required.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Think of MRP as a department.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's say you sell cars.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You need to tell MRP how many cars you already have, how many cars you want to sell, give them the bill of materials for the car (in this case it will be a multiple level bill of materials bc the car is complex), and how much of the components of the car you already have.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Capacity Planning

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here, just remember to keep checking the capacity in each step.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Distribution Requirements Planning (DRP)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now that you produced the product you need to distribute the product.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You use DRP system which is just like MRP but for distributions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Enterprise Requirements Planning Systems (ERP)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Computer programs (like Oracle) that do all the work for you and provides a place for supply chain memebers to share information to prevent the bull effect.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What's the alternative to an ERP? 5 billion excel sheets.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### 2 types of ways to implement ERP Systems

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Single Intergrator Solution:  Choose 1 company and use it for everything.  

Con: Their accounting system is the best it's not as good in logistics which brings us to the second choice companies have, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**2.** Best of Breed: Choose the best company for each department.  

Con: Can be complex and expensive to make it happen.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
