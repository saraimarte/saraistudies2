**Customer-Centric Organization:** the philosophy of putting the customer first.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Why do we do CRM?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The goal is for customers to be loyal to us, for us to aquire new customers, help meet their expectations and automate tasks.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

CRM also helps us...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Categorize customers who have similar characteristics** making it easier for us to provide marketing that applies to all of them so we can minimizie costs.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Predict customer behaviors** which we can use to forecast demand.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do Event Based Marketing like black friday.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do Cross-Selling: Trying to **make total purchase larger** but while offering a product that complements the items you already have.
Ex. If you go and buy a burger, they will ask you if you want fries. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do Up-Selling: Still trying to make a larger sale but they are trying to **sell you something more expensive**.  
Ex. If you go buy an ipad with the lowest memory, but they tell you to buy the ipad with more memory that's more expensive.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Customer defection analysis helps you analyse **why a customer left**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Who is CRM for?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Key customers who overtime you see the life-time value they may be able to give you.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# What is customer Service?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Can be viewed in different lens: as a philosophy, activity, perfromance measure.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Elements
