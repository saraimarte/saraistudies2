# What is CRM?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Customer-Centric Organization:** the philosophy of putting the customer first.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Customer Relationship Management (CRM):** the means by which a company becomes a customer centric organization. It involves taking key customers, ehancing their experience so they will remain customers for life.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Why do we do CRM?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The goal is for customers to be loyal to us, for us to aquire new customers, help meet their expectations and automate tasks.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

CRM also helps us...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Categorize customers who have similar characteristics** making it easier for us to provide marketing that applies to all of them so we can minimizie costs.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Predict customer behaviors** which we can use to forecast demand.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do Event Based Marketing like black friday.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do Customer defection analysis. Helps you analyse **why a customer left**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do Cross-Selling: Trying to **make total purchase larger** while offering a product that complements the items you already have.
Ex. If you go and buy a burger, they will ask you if you want fries. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do Up-Selling: Still trying to make a larger sale but they are trying to **sell you something more expensive**.  
Ex. If you go buy an ipad with the lowest memory, but they tell you to buy the ipad with more memory that's more expensive.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Having a bad CRM can hinder your ability to mantain your customers.

# What is customer Service?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Can be viewed in different lens: as a philosophy, activity, performance measure.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Generally, it is the act of *servicing* the customers before, during and after their purchase.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Pre-transaction services:** before the sale, customer service policies, mission statement, system flexibility.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Transaction services:** during sale, order lead time, organizational structure.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Post-transaction services:** complaint resolution, warranty repairs, returned items. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The right customer service... 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Seven R's Rule:** Right product, quality, quantity, place, time, customer, costs.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
