# Chapter 9

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Definition

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You can have all the products done but if you can't deliver them then everything was for nothing. Which is why logistics is an imporant part of the supply chain.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Logistics includes warehousing, transporation and reverse logistics (what happens when customers return orders.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Warehousing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Primary Functions 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Receive products.
**2.** Store products.
**3.** Pick products that were ordered.
**4.** Pack products.
**5.** Ship products.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You can also do some other things in a warehouse like...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Quality Inspection.  
**2.** Repackaging for special orders.   
**3.** Assembly Operation (like assemble products with advertising flyers or instruction manuals)    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We will look at the types of warehouses by ownership and by funciton/purpose.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Types of Warehouses by Ownership

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Public Warehouse (like those warehouses you go and store your things in by renting a unit.) No property taxes. Flexible. But space may sometimes not be available and there may not be any customization.    
**2.** Store products (You don't own the warehouse but you rent it for x amount of years. There may be some customization but you're stuck in contract and may not be able to leave.)  
**3.** Private Warehouse (You own it. More control. Less cost. But you have to invest in making it. But if you regret building it in a location, you can't change that, you'll have to sell it.)  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Types of warehouses by their functions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Consolidation Warehouse

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Warehouse that receives products from different suppliers and mixes the products and ships them to customers. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Warehouses should be placed closer to suppliers to optimize the truck loads.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Break-Bulk Warehouse 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Warehouse that receives shipments that are full and break them into smaller shipments that will be shipped to customers.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You want warehouse to be close to customers and far away from suppliers. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Cross-Dock Warehouse

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Like Amazon. Multiple suppliers will supply to one dock and then from that dock we will distribute to customers.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It's a combination of both previous functions.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Warehouse Network

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Single Warehouse 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Less complicated and expensive. Inventory costs will be lower. May take longer to deliver the product.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Multiple Warehouses

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Everybody gets their products faster because you have a warehouse more near to them than others but it's more complex and expensive.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Hybird Approach

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Operating and inventory costs are lower and customer serive is overall better.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Third Party Logistics (3PL)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Some companies have other companies take care of their logistics like UPS or FedEx. You can use more than one.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Advantages:** Costs less than doing it yourself. They are experts and efficient. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Disadvantages:** You are dependent on them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Third Party Logistics (4PL)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
A company that manages all the 3PL companies you use. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

May be more expensive. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Transporation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) Rail
(2) Air
(3) Pipeline
(4) Truck
(5) Water 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I remember it as RAP + T.W like RAP and then T.W from the show <a href = "https://youtu.be/gYn1Em-4CQ4?t=13">Arthur.</a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Intermodal:** using a combination of transportation for one shipment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Trucks 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

More flexible.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

80% of products moved in the U.S are moved by truck.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Rails 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Cost is better than truck because you can transport a lot more with a train than a truck. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Less flexible because you need rails.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Usually combined with trucks. Trucks carry the products to the rails.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Air 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Most expensive. Good for urgent needs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Usually not used for consumer goods or raw materials.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Even less flexible because some things you need to transport might not fit. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Usually combined with trucks. Trucks carry the products to the rails.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Pipeline
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Lowest cost per unit. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Very inflexible because you can only ship gases or liquids.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Water/Sea

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Inexpensive. Very slow and inflexible.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Usually combined with trucks because once shipments get to the port they get put into a truck.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Sometimes you have less than a truck load to ship...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So you go to a freight forwarder who fills a truck with your products and another companies product that are going to the same place.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Logistics Managemnet Software Applications 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There are logistic systems part of the ERP that are in charge of transporation, warehousing, and things that are imported or exported.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Reverse Logistics 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When a customer returns an order.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## The 5 R's of Reverse Logistics. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These are 5 cases where reverse logistics are involved. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Customer **returns** products b/c of damanges, defects, etc.  
**2.** Customer returns products b/c the company **recalled** the products b/c they realized they were unsafe. 
**3.** When products are returned, they are sometimes not thrown away, instead companies **repair** them and return it to stock.    
**4.** When products are returned, they are sometimes returned because customers just weren't happy with them not because anything was defective so companies just **repackage** the product and returned to inventory.    
**5.** When products are returned, companies must find safe and cost efficient ways to throw them away sometimes so they sometimes **recycling** components.

# Chapter 10 Global Logistics 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Facility Types

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1. Offshore Factory:** located where materials or labor are less expensive. (Clothes => Asia)
**2. Source Factory:** an offshore factory but has skilled workers.    
**3. Server Factory:** you look at everything and then locate where the incentives is the deciding factor. Given incentives to do something or to simply just locate there (Exeptions of taxes). Trying to take advantage of low labor and material costs.  
**4. Contributor Factory:** get some engineering/ development done. source factory but also developing products.   
**5. Outpost Factory:** located where you are close to research facilities, suppliers, universities that will help you.  
**6. Lead Factory:** where companies try/test things out first like technology or developments that you later roll down to other factories, go to place where you send people to train, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Factors that play a role in where you will locate your facility:

**1. Taxes and Incentives:** are there incentives? are you saving money? will there be taxes that you would have in this location?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**2. Currency Stability:** currency should be stable. If you pay people in the U.S and Brazil, and the currency of dollars or real changes a lot that can be a problem.      

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**3. Access and Proximity to Markets:** are you close to your customers to deliver to them?   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4. Labor Issues:** labor should be available. Is there labor avaliable? How many? How are there skills? How does unemployment look like? How is the turnover/how long do they stay working?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**5. Right-to-work laws:** do you want to be in a state that supports unions and worker's rights?    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**6. Access to Suppliers and Cost:** are your suppliers close to you?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**7. Utilities:** do you have enough utilities for your products? Lot's of electricity? Water? Gas? At a reasonable cost?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**8. Environmental Issues:** do you pollute a lot? do you do things that are non environmentlly friendly?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**9. Land:** is there land avaliable?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**10. Quality of Life:** will people live here? things can be cheap but is the location good for your workers to live here? Will they be able to have a life? educate their children? feel safe?   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**11. Business Clusters:** will you be close to people who are doing similar things as you so they can help you out?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: Homework 3 not given during the summer. It has a score card equivalent for locations considering all the factors above.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Chapter 10 International Trade

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Why operate/sell internationally?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1. Increae revenue:** more opportunities to earn money/ get more customers. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**2. Increase sourcing options:** if you run out of local suppliers you can use international suppliers.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Why **not** operate/sell internationally?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1. Tarrifs**  
**2. Custom Regulations**  
**3. Transportation of goods**  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## International Trade Compliance 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

An average shipment across the borders consists of:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** 35 documents.   
**2.** Comply witth 600+ laws and 500 trade agreements.      
**3.** Contact with 25 groups like customs, freight forwarders, etc.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Trade Compliance systems

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sometimes it's hard to keep up with compliance so companies use these systems the keep current with all the changing laws. 

## Free Trade Zones (FTZ's)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Physical areas in the U.S where you can leave your goods so you don't have to pay duities on it because they are technically not inside the country yet.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Import Process 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Export Process

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Shipments must comply with export administration regulations: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Complete the Shippers Export Declaration (SED)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Global Logistics Interrmediaries 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1. Custom Brokers:** move shipments through customs and handle documentation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**2. International Freight Forwarders:** move goods to and from foreign location.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**3. Trading companies:** they put together buyers and sellers and handle all the imports, exports, documentation.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4. Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers (NVOCC):** freight forwarders but for ocean shipments?
