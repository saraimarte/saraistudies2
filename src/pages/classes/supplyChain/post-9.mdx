# Definition

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You can have all the products done but if you can't deliver them then everything was for nothing. Which is why logistics is an imporant part of the supply chain.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Logistics includes warehousing, transporation and reverse logistics (what happens when customers return orders.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Warehousing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Primary Functions 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Receive products.
**2.** Store products.
**3.** Pick products that were ordered.
**4.** Pack products.
**5.** Ship products.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You can also do some other things in a warehouse like...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Quality Inspection.  
**2.** Repackaging for special orders.   
**3.** Assembly Operation (like assemble products with advertising flyers or instruction manuals)    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We will look at the types of warehouses by ownership and by funciton/purpose.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Types of Warehouses by Ownership

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Public Warehouse (like those warehouses you go and store your things in by renting a unit.) No property taxes. Flexible. But space may sometimes not be available and there may not be any customization.    
**2.** Store products (You don't own the warehouse but you rent it for x amount of years. There may be some customization but you're stuck in contract and may not be able to leave.)  
**3.** Private Warehouse (You own it. More control. Less cost. But you have to invest in making it. But if you regret building it in a location, you can't change that, you'll have to sell it.)  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Types of warehouses by their functions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Consolidation Warehouse

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Warehouse that receives products from different suppliers and mixes the products and ships them to customers. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Warehouses should be placed closer to suppliers to optimize the truck loads.

### Break-Bulk Warehouse 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Warehouse that receives shipments that are full and break them into smaller shipments that will be shipped to customers.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You want warehouse to be close to customers and far away from suppliers. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Cross-Dock Warehouse

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Like Amazon. Multiple suppliers will supply to one dock and then from that dock we will distribute to customers.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It's a combination of both previous functions.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Warehouse Network

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Single Warehouse 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Less complicated and expensive. Inventory costs will be lower. May take longer to deliver the product.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Multiple Warehouses

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Everybody gets their products faster because you have a warehouse more near to them than others but it's more complex and expensive.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Hybird Approach

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Operating and inventory costs are lower and customer serive is overall better.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Third Party Logistics (3PL)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Some companies have other companies take care of their logistics like UPS or FedEx. You can use more than one.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Advantages:** Costs less than doing it yourself. They are experts and efficient. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Disadvantages:** You are dependent on them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Third Party Logistics (4PL)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
A company that manages all the 3PL companies you use. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

May be more expensive. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Transporation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) Rail
(2) Air
(3) Pipeline
(4) Truck
(5) Water 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I remember it as RAP + T.W like RAP and then T.W from the show <a href = "https://youtu.be/gYn1Em-4CQ4?t=13">Arthur.</a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Intermodal:** using a combination of transportation for one shipment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Trucks 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

More flexible.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

80% of products moved in the U.S are moved by truck.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Rails 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Cost is better than truck because you can transport a lot more with a train than a truck. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Less flexible because you need rails.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Usually combined with trucks. Trucks carry the products to the rails.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Air 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Most expensive. Good for urgent needs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Usually not used for consumer goods or raw materials.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Even less flexible because some things you need to transport might not fit. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Usually combined with trucks. Trucks carry the products to the rails.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Pipeline
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Lowest cost per unit. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Very inflexible because you can only ship gases or liquids.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Water/Sea

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Inexpensive. Very slow and inflexible.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Usually combined with trucks because once shipments get to the port they get put into a truck.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Sometimes you have less than a truck load to ship...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So you go to a freight forwarder who fills a truck with your products and another companies product that are going to the same place.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Logistics Managemnet Software Applications 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There are logistic systems part of the ERP that are in charge of transporation, warehousing, and things that are imported or exported.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Reverse Logistics 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When a customer returns an order.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## The 5 R's of Reverse Logistics. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These are 5 cases where reverse logistics are involved. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Customer **returns** products b/c of damanges, defects, etc.  
**2.** Customer returns products b/c the company **recalled** the products b/c they realized they were unsafe. 
**3.** When products are returned, they are sometimes not thrown away, instead companies **repair** them and return it to stock.    
**4.** When products are returned, they are sometimes returned because customers just weren't happy with them not because anything was defective so companies just **repackage** the product and returned to inventory.    
**5.** When products are returned, companies must find safe and cost efficient ways to throw them away sometimes so they sometimes **recycling** components.
