# How is the service industry different then a manufacturing industry?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1. Tangibility:** you can't touch the products...because they're services. 
**2. Involvement of the customer:** 
**3. Assessment of quality:** 
**4. Labor Content:** 
**5. Facility Location:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Types of Service 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1. Pure Service:**

**2. End Products:**

**3. State Utility:**

(We don't have to remember these)

How you manage your service capacity and waiting times.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Demand Management Tactics:**

EX. your a parking lot in the city. you have like 10 people who help you park the cars. if everybody comes in at 10am then you don't have enough people to park them so you say if you come before 9am you get the early bird price. You control when people come. Not just at one time.
EX. plane tickets are cheaper in the week than on weekends. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Not enough capacity 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## When you have too much capacity 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Challenges 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Customers fluctuate. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## What does capacity look like?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Queue**: If you have people wait you will set up queues. There are 3 different types of queues depending on what you want to do and what activities you're doing. Connect this with LEAN and Six Sigma. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1. Mobile Queue. Like McDonalds or Olive Garden**
**2.**
**3.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# The 5 dimensions of service quality

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empahty, tangibles.
