# What is Supply Chain Management (SCM)?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Goal of Supply Chain Management:** increase customer service while decreasing both inventory investment and operating expenses. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## (1) What is the Supply Chain?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Supply chain management starts with understanding the flow of...well, supplies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The supply chain is a series of <s>nodes</s> <s>links</s> <s>phases</s> steps that are needed to supply a product (toothpaste tubes) or service (car wash service).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In a manufacturing company, there is you the company, the suppliers and the customers. There are different <s>types</s> <s>levels</s> tiers of both suppliers and customers. See below.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These steps are connected by warehousing and transportation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Think about it. How do you think the finished materials suppliers get their supplies to the manufacturers? By transporting the supplies either by: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) Rail
(2) Air
(3) Pipeline
(4) Truck
(5) Water 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I remember it as RAP + T.W like RAP and then T.W from the show <a href = "https://youtu.be/gYn1Em-4CQ4?t=13">Arthur.</a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Intermodal:** using a combination of transportation for one shipment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Supply Chain Disruption

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Within the supply chain, there can be some disruptions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If only 1 supplier stops supplying to the manufacturer (your company) and 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

all other suppliers are still supplying. Yet, you can't sell your goods to distributors because you're missing 1 key part of your product. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, the distributors will continute to sell whatever inventory they have in stock until they run out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Once they run out, you will have to cease receiving supplies from other suppliers because you can't do anything if you don't have that 1 key part from that one supplier that's not supplying. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Hence, one disruption by one supplier can disrupt the entire supply chain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We know that a chain is only as good as it's weakest link.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Supply Chain Management in the Service Industry 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We talk a lot about manufacturing companies that *manufacture* products like phones or toothpaste.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yet, there are service companies like car washes or dry cleanings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Although these companies don't supply tangible products, they may involve the use of tangible products.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For example, car washing companies may have a supply chain for their towels they use to dry the cars after the wash. They need suppliers to supply those towels.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## (2) SCOR Model

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

All supply chains follow the SCOR model and so do the chapters in this class.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) **Plan** - Forecasting and Demand Planning, Supply Chain Planning and Inventory Management  
(2) **Source** - Purchasing Management, Strategic Sourcing, Supplier Relationship Management  
(3) **Make**- Operations Management   
(4) **Deliver**- Warehousing, Transportation, Global Logistics, Customer Relationship Management, Supply Chain Management in the Service Industry  
(5) **Enable** (this step is happening simultaneously) - Project Management, Performance Measurement, Supply Chain Integration  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Business Models

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There are 2 types of business models or companies: push and pull.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Push Model (Made to Stock Company)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is the most used model.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pros: Products are always avaliable to ship to the customers.  
Cons: They may have high inventory and that's not always a good thing because they have to pay for the storage of that inventory.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: Crayola Crayons Manufactures. Crayola has stock of their crayons. They make to stock.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Pull Model (Made to Order Company)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pros: Reduces waste, flexible, orders can be customizable.  
Cons: There is pressure for the order to be perfect and on time - any mistakes can lead to customer dissatisfaction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: Plane Manufactures. The plane companies don't just have planes laying around. When the planes are ordered then they are made.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**The way I remember...**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Push is made to stock because they *push* the goods to shelves. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pull is made to order because they *pull* or *retain* their making of products until someone orders.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
