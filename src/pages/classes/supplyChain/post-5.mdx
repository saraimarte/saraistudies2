# The Basic of Purchasing Process (The Steps)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Problem: We need caps for our toothpaste bottles. “We” = The Company

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 1:** We need caps for our toothpaste bottles again...I'll have to submit a PO for it but first..  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 2:** I have to ask for permission/authorization if needed...I got it. But before submitting the PO...  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 3:** I have to make a list of suppliers that can supply me these caps and evaluate them if I don’t know which supplier I’m going to use already.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 4:** I will hold a bid and issue an RFP (or a RFQ) so I can get all the info I need to compare suppliers. RFP- Request for Proposal:  Request this when you have not purchased from this supplier already. It's a document that includes their 'pitch' as to why you should pick them that includes prices and delivery. RFQ - Request for Quotation: Request this when you have purchased from a supplier already. Document that just includes price and delivery quote on the specific items requested. We use these in the bidding process to determine which supplier has the best price, quality, availability, delivery costs, etc. for us.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 5:** After the bid, supplier #1 was selected. Finally, I can create and submit the PO. Purchase Order (PO): A document that represents the buyers formal offer to the supplier to obtain the item(s). It will list the item(s) that we need, how many we need, when we need it, where we need it to be delivered to, the prices to be paid, and any conditions related to the order. It becomes a binding contract only when supplier accepts the order.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 6:** Supplier #1 confirms the PO so now the document is legally binding.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 7:** Supplier fulfills the order and we receive the caps.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 8:** Receipt of Goods: We have to check that the caps are in good quality and we received the exact  quantity we ordered. in the PO.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 9:** Receive Invoice. The supplier just sent us the invoice for the caps (sometimes the invoice comes in step 7 with the items )  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 10:** Do a Reconciliation (3-way match). We Check that the PO, invoice and goods receipt all have the same numbers.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 11:** Payment. I just paid the suppliers the $2 +$1 for tax.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 12:** Sometimes the supplier charges tax... and they did so I'm going to reclaim some (or all) of the taxes through the gov.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 13:** Close the purchase order - take it out of the system.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Step 14:** Analysis. The purchasing department analyzes by measuring efficiency and accuracy of the process.  
We can look at the time the delivery was made if the supplier was late or early. If the quantity of goods had good quality, how much didn’t etc. to measure efficiency.

# World-Class Procurement Organization

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What does a good world class Procurement organization look like? What do they do? How can they help the company?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

They benchmark. They compare themselves to the best and see what they could be doing better, improve and be even better.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These companies or people also get involved in improving the purchasing function like making aquisition decisionns - if a company should buy another company or not.
