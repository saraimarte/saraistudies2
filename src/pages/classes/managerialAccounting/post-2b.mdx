# Intro
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The end goal of this chapter is to complete an income statement, which you should be familiar with from finacial accounting.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

An income statement just states how much you really earned. It's your Revenues - Expenses = Net Income.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In managerial, expenses are more thought of as costs so it's really Revenues - Costs = Net Income.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, in managerial (for now) we will do Revenues - Costs = Operating Income (Net Income is after taxes).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But what is considered Revenues and what is considered costs?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well it all starts with the value chain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# The Value Chain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Value Chain: Is the chain of steps a business takes to produce value (a product/service).

All busineses start with researching and developing a product, then they design the product, then they produce (manufacture) the product and so on. 

Within each of those steps there are research and development costs, design costs and production (manufacturing) costs. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


<div style = "object-fit:contain" >
    <img src={imgurl3.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" /> 
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Every cost that falls under the green steps goes under operational costs in the income statement (Including GAS Costs, General, Administrative, Sales Costs. Basically any cost that has nothing to do with producing the product in the plant/factory).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain" >
    <img src={imgurl4.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" /> 
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And the only costs left are production costs. In production of a product, there's manufacturing of the product and with manufacturing comes manufacturing costs. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There are two types of manufacturing costs (1) Direct (2) Indirect. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There are two Direct and one indirect (1) Direct Materials (DM) (2) Direct Labor (DL) (3) Manufacturing Overhead (MOH)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Take a lucky guess at which are the direct costs. As for Manufacturing Overhead- that's just a fancy way of saying indirect costs. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It's all the costs that are indirectly related to the manufacturing of the product.

    <img src={imgurl.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" /> 
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Manufacturing Costs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Manufacturing Costs (aka inventoriable costs) is just a fancy way of saying cost of goods sold.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Think about it, the cost of the goods you sold in a manufacturing company is the same cost of the goods you manufactured. Because to sell the goods you had to manufacture them in the first place no?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is the main point of this chapter. It's all about getting to COGS (cost of goods sold) because the hard part isn't putting it into an income statement- it's finding it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But how do you get to COGS?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


# Operating Costs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Operating Costs (aka period costs) is literally every other cost. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Rememeber GAS (General, Adminitrative, Sales Costs).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


It includes costs in every phase of a business except for the production/manufacturing phase.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Basicaly any cost that is not a manufacturing/plant cost is an operating cost.
