No, CVP doesn't mean customer value proposition you management peeps.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It means cost-volume profit analysis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What do you think it's all about? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Costs, Volume and Profits!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(Volume means amount of units btw.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

CVP analysis helps managers answer the question, "How are revenues, total costs, or operating income going to be effected if I change either the costs or the volume of the products sold?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

They ask this question because it helps them see the various outcomes they can have. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Butttt out of all the different amounts of units they sell or prices they can sell their goods for, managers will select the option that will give them the highest operating income. In other terms, the most amount of $$ mula $$.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As my marco prof always says, two main goals of a CEO (in this case- of a manager) are to (1) maximize profits (2) decrease expenses.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And we know from our fancy financial accounting skills,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

the more operating income you're left with, the more profit you'll have at the end. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

mmm okay- so, many managers who do CVP analysis use the Contribution Income Statement to help them see the effects of costs on operating income more accurately.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This means, that we're going from using this 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain" >
    <img src={imgurl1.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" /> 
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

to using this 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain" >
    <img src={imgurl2.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" /> 
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What's contribution margin?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is simply what's left over of revenues to cover fixed costs. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We can also use CM to find how much each product *contributes* to covering fixed costs-  we call this CM/unit read as "Contribution Margin per Unit".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Before I show you how to find all these things, let me give you a picture of what all these components look like in a car manufacturing company.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain" >
    <img src={vid1.src} alt="vid1" width="100%" height="auto" /> 
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Remember, total DM are always variable costs because they depend on how many units are produced. The more cars you produce the more materials go into them. DM in this case can be steel. Let's say that that we had total DM costs of $200 and we sold $500 worth of cars (so prob 1 car lol).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When we subtract variable costs from revenues we get contribution margin. It is, again, how much is left to cover fixed costs. We have $300 of CM.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What are fixed costs? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's say that the only fixed costs we had were for the rent of the factory we make the cars in of $100. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So now we subtract fixed costs from CM. $300 - $100 and we get $200 of operating income!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Then, we put those components into the CM Income Statement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain" >
    <img src={vid2.src} alt="vid1" width="100%" height="auto" /> 
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

voila! 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Okok, enough talking, the best way to learn CVP is to do it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's start.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 1| Fill in the blanks

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


### Example 2| Breakeven Analysis |  Find out amount of units to be sold or total revenue needed to be made in order to break even.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 3| Margin of Safety|  Find out how safe you are until you no longer are making profit or breaking even.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Finishing the Income Statement

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We know from our fancy financial accounting skills that income statements don't just end with operating income (OI)- they end with net income (NI). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What's the difference, well NI = OI- taxes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It's literally the same thing we've been doing except now we're just throwing taxes into the equation. See, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain" >
    <img src={imgurl3.src} alt="vid1" width="100%" height="auto" /> 
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l3vQY4uui06iabkli" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/colbertlateshow-confused-l3vQY4uui06iabkli"></a></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

yes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now let's practice CVP with taxes!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


### Example 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 2
