Have you ever had wingstop?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/ieazXppkHJGENspB9P" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/bww-buffalo-wild-wings-bdubs-ieazXppkHJGENspB9P"></a></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

or are you more of a buffalo wild wings person?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Either way, when you walk into wingstop you don't go to just buy one single wing. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You go to buy a basket of wings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, that basket may contain bone-in wings and boneless wings. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's say you order that basekt. (Although, I would never, i'm an all bone-in wings type of girl tyvm.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Notice that in the basket there are two different types of wings- two different *goods*. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This introduces the question of how in the world wide world do we make a basket that will make us profits. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

How do we know how many of each type of wing to put in?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

How many baskets does wingstop need to sell to break even?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What's the right *bundle* of wings, the right *sales mix* of wings, the right *basket* of wings? (All terms can be interchangeably used)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's find out with an example.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


### Example 1| Bundle Method

### Example 2| Weighted Average Method
