# What is the difference between absorption and variable costing?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Absorption considers both variable and fixed costs under inventoriable costs.
Variable Costing only considers variable costs as inventoriable costs- fixed manufacturing costs are put under operating expenses or what we call period costs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You have already done this.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Absoprotion costing is just making the income statment you first learned in chapter 2.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Variable costing is just making the contribution margin income statement you learned in chapter 3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sara sells a notebook for $30 per unit. Last year, 30,000 notebooks were produced but only 20,000 were sold. Other information for the period includes:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<table>
 <tr>
        <th style = "text-align:start">Description</th>
        <th style = "text-align:start">Amount</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Direct Materials</td>
        <td>$20.00 per unit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Direct Manufacturing Labor</td>
        <td>$5.00 per unit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Variable Manufacturing Costs</td>
        <td>$2.00 per unit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Fixed Manufacturing Costs</td>
        <td>$10.00 per unit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sales Commissions</td>
        <td>$3.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Fixed Administrative Expenses</td>
        <td>$7.00</td>
    </tr>
</table>

        <td>Beginning inventory, January 1, 2023</td>
        <td>50,000 units</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ending inventory, December 31, 2023</td>
        <td>22,000 units</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2023 sales</td>
        <td>250,000 units</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Selling price </td>
        <td>$25.00 per unit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Variable manufacturing cost per unit</td>
        <td>$2.00 per unit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Variable operating (marketing) cost per unit sold</td>
        <td>$3.50 per unit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Fixed manufacturing costs</td>
        <td>$1,200,500</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Denominator-level machine-hours</td>
        <td>4,500</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Standard production rate</td>
        <td>10 units per machine-hour</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Fixed operating (marketing) costs</td>
        <td>$850,000</td>
    </tr>
</table>
