Honestly, these are the easiest types of problems. You are just trying to find how much you're paying your employees, how much of it is DL, how much of it is IL and how much of it is Idle Time/Overtime.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Last week, Alex spent 48 hours working at GearCraft Industries. Out of these hours, 5 were designated as extra hours due to increased workload, and Alex was also unoccupied for 4 hours because of a technical issue with the equipment. Alex earns $50 per hour and receives $75 per hour (time and a half) for the additional hours. Alex's total earnings for that week would be, and assuming GearCraft Industries accounts for extra hours and idle time under indirect labor, the amount recorded under indirect labor for this compensation would be:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A) $2,525; $325

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

B) $2,900; $280

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

C) $2,750; $300

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


D) $2,500; $350

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 2

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Emily Turner is employed at a ceramics studio. She maintains a regular schedule of 40-hour weeks spread across 5 days, earning $25 per hour. In the initial week of the year, she logged a total of 38 hours of active work. However, she received payment for 46 hours because the pottery shop was closed on the first day of the year, yet she still received compensation for that day. Over the subsequent four days, she worked an additional 1.5 hours beyond her regular shift each day. Determine the portions of her payment attributed to direct labor and indirect labor, respectively.
