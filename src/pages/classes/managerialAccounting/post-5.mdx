Honestly, these are the easiest types of problems. You are just trying to find how much you're paying your employees, how much of it is DL, how much of it is IL and how much of it is Idle Time/Overtime.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Last week, Alex spent 48 hours working at GearCraft Industries. Out of these hours, 5 were designated as extra hours due to increased workload, and Alex was also unoccupied for 4 hours because of a technical issue with the equipment. Alex earns $50 per hour and receives $75 per hour (time and a half) for the additional hours. Alex's total earnings for that week would be, and assuming GearCraft Industries accounts for extra hours and idle time under indirect labor, the amount recorded under indirect labor for this compensation would be:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A) $2,575; $325

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

B) $2,900; $280

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

C) $2,750; $300

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


D) $2,500; $350

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 2

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Max Turner is employed at a toy workshop. He usually works a regular schedule of 40-hour weeks spread across Mondays to Fridays, earning $15 per hour. In the first week of the year, he performed 35 hours of active work. However, he received payment for 42 hours because the toy workshop was closed on the first day of the year, yet he still got paid for that day. Over the next three days, he worked 2 hours in addition to his regular shift each day. How much of what he got paid was direct labor and how much of it was indirect labor respectively?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A) $2,575; $105

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

B) $3,560; $380

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

C) $1,700; $200

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


D) $1,500; $150
