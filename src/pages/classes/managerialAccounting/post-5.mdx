Honestly, these are the easiest types of problems. You are just trying to find how much you're paying your employees, how much of it is DL, how much of it is IL and how much of it is Idle Time/Overtime.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Some things to know: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Idle time = time you are paid for - time you are not working   
Overtime payment = regular pay + in excess of regular pay (extra mula for working extra hours)  
Straight Time = Regular Time  
Regular Time = Total Time - Idle Time  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's practice! 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 1 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sarai Calore is paid $25 for straight-time and $45 for overtime. Last week, she worked 48 hours of which 6 hours were overtime and 2 were idle-time caused by a power outage. How much is Sarai getting paid for last week? How much of it is attributed to Direct Labor? Indirect Labor? Respectively.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A) $1320;$660;$660

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

B) $1320;$1200;$120

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

C) $1320;$1270;$50

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

D) $1320;$1150;$170



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 2 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Last week, Alex spent 48 hours working at GearCraft Industries. Out of these hours, 5 were designated as extra hours due to increased workload, and Alex was also unoccupied for 4 hours because of a technical issue with the equipment. Alex earns $50 per hour and receives $75 per hour (time and a half) for the additional hours. Alex's total earnings for that week would be what? Also, assuming GearCraft Industries accounts for extra hours and idle time under indirect labor, the amount recorded under indirect labor for this compensation would be:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A) $2,525; $325

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

B) $2,900; $280

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

C) $2,750; $300

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


D) $2,500; $350


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 3 

Max Turner is employed at a toy workshop. He usually works a regular schedule of 40-hour weeks spread across Mondays to Fridays, earning $15 per hour. If he goes beyond his regular working hours then he get's paid $22.50 (time and a half). In the first week of the year, he performed 35 hours of active work. However, he received payment for 42 hours because the toy workshop was closed on the first day of the year, yet he still got paid for that day. Over the next three days, he worked 2 hours in addition to his regular shift each day. How much of what he got paid was direct labor and how much of it was indirect labor respectively?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A) $521; $105

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

B) $423; $100

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

C) $525; $150

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

D) $600; $235
