The problem: Can you afford to hire a new worker or not?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

One factor to consider is if it's worth hiring this new worker. As in, will they catch on quickly to the job or will they take a long time to get used to things?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Solution: Find out how long it will take a new worker to catch up. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

How do we do that?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There are two methods: (1) incremental method and (2) Cumulative Average method

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Incremental Method

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The idea is that everytime you double the amount of units that you make, you will get better with time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Make sense right, the more practice, the better?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For these problems, you will always be given the learning curve.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's start with an example.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So I came up with a little acronym for these problems: USAT.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

US**A**T - use it for the cumlative **A**verage method

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

US ̷A̷ T - use it for incremental method but without the A

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

U: Units  
S: Single time  
A: Average Time  
T: Total Time  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
