Last chapter we made budgets. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Remember, budgets are just numbers we as managers estimate in the beginning of a period. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Not everything goes as planned though.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For example, we can estimate that we will make 15 cars by the end of the year but then our actual production at the end of the year could end up being 5 cars. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This chapter is all about calculating the difference between what you estimated at the start of the period vs what actually happend at the end of the period.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We call these differences variances.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sometimes these variances are good, sometimes they are bad. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Good variances are called favorable variances.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Bad variances are called unfavorable variances.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Whether a variance is good or bad depends on what you're comparing. In this case our variance is 10 (15-5). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But is it a good or bad variance?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, we made less cars than we planned for- and that is not a good thing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It's bad.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So this would be an unfavorable variance of 10 cars. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But if you were comparing costs and let's say you estimated your costs were going to be $15 but they ended up being $5.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Then your variance is still $10 but is the variance good or bad?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, costs went *down* so that difference is *good* so hence a favorable variance of $10.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

See, whether or not a variance is unfavorable or favorable depends on what you're comparing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Less production is not good but less costs are good.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here, is a cheat sheet you can reference while you're doing the problems.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <summary>Cheat Sheet</summary>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Tip: Everytime you do a problem- try writing down the formula first, then refer to this sheet to get what you're missing. Keep doing this and you'll train your brain to recall the formulas and you won't need to look at the sheet anymore!

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Note: I also have a way I remember them without looking at the sheet. See the example videos where I explain it.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    **Static Budget Variance** = Actual - Static

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    **Flexible Budget Variance** = Actual - Flex

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    **Sales Volume Variance** = Flex - Static

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    **Price Variance = Actual** - Flex Input

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Tells us if we paid more or less than we expected to pay.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    **Efficiency Variance** = Flex Input - Flex

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Tells us if we used more or less input that we expected to use.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    *The sign does not determine whether or not a variance is unfavorable or favorable- it depends on what you're comparing.
