Company: Pencil Manufacture

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Your company has a machine that was recently purchased with $5,000 and makes 5,000 pencils per month. It's depreciatied using straight line depreciation with 0 residual value over 5 years.
Your company currently produces and sells 4,000 pencils a month. Direct materials costs are 20 cents per pencil. Fixed manufacturing costs include rent for the wharehouse, other costs and totals $2,000 per month.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li style = "list-style:none">(1) What is the annual relevant range of output?</li>
<li style = "list-style:none">(2) What are the relevant annual fixed and variable manufacturing costs? </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### <li style = "list-style:none">(1) What is the annual relevant range of **output** ?</li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For this type of question identify your cost object.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Cost Object: Pencil.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Great, now just replace the word output in the question with the cost object. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"What is the annual relevant range of **pencils**?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

They're simply asking how many pencils you *can* make in a year (*not* how many you are currently making in a year.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, find how many pencils you have the *capacity* of making in a year. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"Your company has a machine that was recently purchased with $7,000 and makes 5,000 pencils per month."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, we see that the machine we purchased has the capacity to make 5,000 pencils *per month*. But we want to know how many pencils it can make *per year*.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

5000 pencils/month* 12 months  = **60,000 pencils.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, our annual relevant range of output is (0,60000) because we can make from 0 to 60,000 pencils per year (they also asked for a *range*, that's what a range is).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### <li style = "list-style:none">(2) What are the relevant annual fixed and variable manufacturing costs? </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Okay! I love this question because I get to bring up the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell equivalent in managerial and that is...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

drum roll please

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For annual fixed manufacturing costs just go through the big 3. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

DM are never fixed because they vary depending on how many units are produced.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

DL also never fixed because the labor that goes into making the pencils vary depending on how many pencils you make.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

OH can be both fixed (total cost of rent and depreciataion) and variable (total cost of cleaning supplies). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We are told  "Fixed manufacturing costs include rent for the wharehouse, other costs and totals $2,000 per month."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The only fixed costs are OH costs (rent) and the other costs for a total of $2,000 *per month*, the question asks for annual fixed costs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

$2,000 FC/month * 12 months  = $24,000 FC/year

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And now we have to add depreciation. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Depreciation is a fixed manufacturing OH cost because the amount that the machine deprecitates by does not change no matter how much you use it or do not use it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The formula is cost of the machine - residual / year(s) = $5,000 - 0 residual / 5 years = $1,000 fixed depreciation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, total manufacturing fixed costs are $24,000 + $1,000 = **$25,000 FC /year.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What about annual variable manufacturing costs?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, back to the big 3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

DM are variable because they vary depending on how many pencils are made.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

DL costs are variable because they vary depending on how many pencils are made.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

OH costs can be both variable and fixed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We are told, "Direct materials costs are 20 cents per pencil."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We know we make 4,000 pencils a month. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, .20 per pencil x 4,000 pencils per month = $800 DM cost per pencil per month * 12 months = **$9,600 DM per pencil Annually.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Because there is no mention of DL, DM is the only variable cost and so the current annual manufacturing varaible costs are $9,600.
