&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We already discussed the concept of taking the costs through the inventory system but you really want to know <i>how</i> to actually do it, so here we go.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

First you need to remember how to use a t-account.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

All the inventory accounts are asset accounts meaning that debits will increase the account and credits will decrease the account. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain" >
    <img src={imgurl7.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" /> 
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So let's set up the accounts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


<div style = "object-fit:contain" >
    <img src={vid1.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" /> 
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Every inventory account starts with a beginning inventory and ending inventory. COGS is not an inventory account, I have it there because I want to show you where the costs go there after they leave the inventory system. It is also why COGS has BB (for beginning balance) because it has no beginning <i> inventory </i>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain" >
    <img src={vid2.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" /> 
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Each account has 1 thing that increases it (on the left) and 1 thing that decreases it (on the right).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


<div style = "object-fit:contain" >
    <img src={vid3.src} alt="img1" width="100%" height="auto" /> 
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For example, purchases increases the DM acccount while usage decreases it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Think about it, when you purchase DM, you now quite literally have more DM hence you're increasing the DM account - that's why we put purchases on the left (the debit side) to increase the DM account.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Then, the usage of that DM decreases the amount of DM hence we credit the DM acount to decrease it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That DM we used goes to the DM we're in the process of using. Get it? So the DM we used goes into the WIP (Work in Process) account as DM. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The WIP account contains the costs that are inccured in the process of making a product which includes the manufacturing costs, DM + DL + MOH.
What decreases WIP is goods that are no longer in the process of being made so they are now known as COGM - the cost of goods manufactured/completed/done. 
Then, COGM goes into finished goods account because the product is no longer being made- its done - finished - finito hence the Finished Goods account.
The COGM now turn to GAS (Cost of goods avalible for sale) because they are finished goods that are waiting to be sold and once they're sold they leave the inventory system and into- you guessed it- COGS.

Let's do an example,
