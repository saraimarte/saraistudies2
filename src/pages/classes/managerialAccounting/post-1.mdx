## Cost Terms

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li>Cost Object: Anything you can give a price too (House, Car) </li>
<li>Cost: A resource you are sacrificing to obtain a certain object (Cash, Meal Swipes).</li>
<li>Budgeted Cost: The estimated cost.</li>
<li>Actual Cost: The actual cost that occurred.</li>
<li>Cost Driver: What drives up (or down) your costs. </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Classifying Costs

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Context: You own a company that manufactures cars and with manufacturing comes manufacturing costs. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There are 2 ways to classify costs: (1) Direct or Indirect. (2) Fixed or Variable.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ask yourselves these questions...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<hr/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Direct or Indirect

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style = "color:#81b5b7">
"Can it be directly traced back to a specific cost object?" If Yes = Direct Cost. If No = Indirect Cost.
</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ins>Ex1. The total cost of tires. </ins>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Can the cost of tires be directly traced back to a specific car? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 I know how much worth of tires went into making every car. I have the receipts, so the cost of tires is a direct cost.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You can also think of the fact that the tires went directly into making the car. Literally. The tires are on the car.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ins>Ex2. The total cost of rent for the facility you make the cars in. </ins>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Can the cost of rent be directly traced back to a specific car? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

No. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


You do not know how much worth of your total rent went into making a specific car. However it's still a cost of making the car because even though you didn't use rent directly in the making of the car, without renting the facility to make the cars in, you wouldn't have anywhere to make the cars in the first place, so the cost of rent is indirectly related to the making of the cars and hence, an indirect cost.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<hr/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Fixed or Variable

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style = "color:#90cacc">
"Does the cost change if I produce more units?" If Yes = Variable Cost. If No = Fixed Cost.
</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ins>Ex1. The total cost of tires.</ins>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Does the total cost of tires change if I produce more cars?


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Yes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


The more cars you make, the more tires you have to buy for the cars. Hence, the total cost of tires increases/changes/varies so it's a variable cost.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ins>Ex2. The total cost of rent for the facility you make the cars in.</ins>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Does the total cost of rent change if I produce more cars?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

No.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The rent your pay does not change no matter how many cars you make. You can make 1 car or 500 cars this month, you still have to pay up that mula.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<hr/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Fixed and Varible Costs Per Unit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note, so far we have talked about <i> total costs </i> but we can look at costs from another perspective- <i> per unit </i> costs.

Viewing a cost from either the total or per unit perspective does not change whether it's a direct or indirect cost but it does change whether it's a fixed or variable cost.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For example, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ins>Ex1. The cost of tires per unit (per car).</ins>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Does the cost of tires per car change if I produce more cars?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Nope. The cost for tires for every car you make does not change if you make more cars. If you spend $20 on tires for every car you make, you will spend $20 worth of tires for every car no matter if you make 1 car or 200 cars, it' still $20 worth of tires per car.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Hence, the cost of tires <i> per </i> car is a fixed cost. It doesn't change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ins>Ex2. The cost of rent per unit (per car) for the facility you make the cars in.</ins>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Does the cost of rent per car change if I produce more cars?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



Yes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


The cost of rent (you will soon learn this) is allocated (distributed) to all the cars you make. So, if you make 1 car then that 1 car will carry the burden to make up 100% of that rent. If you make 2 cars then those 2 cars will now carry 50% 50% of the burden to make up that rent. Notice that how the cost of rent that every car has to make up varies depending on how many cars are produced, therefore the cost of rent per car is a variable cost.
