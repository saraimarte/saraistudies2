### Cost Terms

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li>Cost Object: Anything you can give a price too (House, Car) </li>
<li>Cost: A resource you are sacrificing to obtain a certain object (Cash, Meal Swipes).</li>
<li>Budgeted Cost: The estimated cost.</li>
<li>Actual Cost: The actual cost that occurred.</li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Classifying Costs

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Context: You own a company that manufactures cars and with manufacturing comes manufacturing costs. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There are 2 ways to classify costs: (1) Direct or Indirect. (2) Fixed or Variable.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ask yourselves these questions...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<hr/>

Direct or Indirect: "Can it be directly traced back to a specific cost object?" If Yes = Direct Cost. If No = Indirect Cost.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ins>Ex1. The cost of tires. </ins>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Can the cost of tires be directly traced back to a specific car? 

Yes. I know how much worth of tires went into making every car. I have the receipts so the cost of tires is a direct cost.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ins>Ex2. The cost of rent for the facility you make the cars in. </ins>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Can the cost of rent be directly traced back to a specific car? 

No. You do not know how much worth of your total rent went into making a specific car. However it's still a cost of making the car because even though you didn't use rent directly in the making of the car, without renting the facility to make the cars in, you wouldn't have any cars to make in the first place so the cost of rent is indirectly related to the making of the cars.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<hr/>

Fixed or Variable: "Does the cost change if I produce more units?" If Yes = Variable Cost. If No = Fixed Cost.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ins>Ex1. The total cost of tires.</ins>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Does the total cost of tires change if I produce more cars?


Yes. The more cars you make, the more tires you have to buy for the cars. Hence, the total cost of tires increases/changes/varies so it's a variable cost.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ins>Ex2. The total cost of rent for the facility you make the cars in.</ins>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Does the total cost of rent change if I produce more cars?


No. The rent your pay does not change no matter how many cars you make. You can make 1 car or 500 cars this month, you still have to pay up that mula.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<hr/>

However, we described total costs when talking about fixed and variable costs but we can also view costs from another perspective: per unit costs.

Total costs per unit may or may not change.
