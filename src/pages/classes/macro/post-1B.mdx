We care about the factors of production because they are the essential building blocks of the economy- they determine what goods are being made, distributed, and how they contribute to the economy's growth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There is no study of economics if there is nothing being produced and nothing can be produced without the following factors.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Four Factors of Production: 

<li style = "list-style:none">(1) Land </li>
<li style = "list-style:none">(2) Labor</li>
<li style = "list-style:none">(3) Capital (*not* cash; we're talking about physical equipment)</li>
<li style = "list-style:none">(4) Entrepreneur </li>

Four Factors of Production in Krispy Pizza: 

<li style = "list-style:none">(1) Land - the land the building is on</li>
<li style = "list-style:none">(2) Labor - the people making the pizza when you walk in.</li>
<li style = "list-style:none">(3) Capital- the ovens that the pizzas are made in</li>
<li style = "list-style:none">(4) Entrepreneur - the owner of Kirspy Pizza</li>
