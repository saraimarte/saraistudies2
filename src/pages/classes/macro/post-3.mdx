&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's say you and your friend are producers of a product.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Absolute Advantage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Given the *same* amount of resources, if you make more of a product than your friend then you have an absolute advantage over them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Comparative Advantage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you can make the product at a lower opportunity cost (so while giving up less stuff), then you have a comparative advantage over your friend because in comparison to them you made the same product but it cost you less.
