&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's say you and I are producers of a product.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Absolute Advantage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Given the *same* amount of resources, if you make more of a product than your friend then you have an absolute advantage over them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example: Who has an absolute advantage?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sarai can make 10 bananas or 2 apples. You can make 8 bananas or 3 apple.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The one who makes the most of the good has the absolute advantage on that good.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I have an absolute advantage in making bananas because I make more bananas than you, given the same amount of resources.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You have an absolute advantage in making apples because you make more apples than me, given the same amount of resources.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Comparative Advantage (The Ricardian Model)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, this guy named Ricky- just kidding. His name was David Ricardo. He came up with the theory of comparative advantage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This model has some assumptions...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li style="list-style:none">(1) Labor is the only factor of production</li>
<li style="list-style:none">(2) Quantity of labor is fixed </li>
<li style="list-style:none">(3) We only look at 2 goods/countries/producers </li>
<li style="list-style:none">(4) Technology is constant </li>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you can make the product at a lower opportunity cost (so while giving up less stuff), then you have a comparative advantage over your friend because in comparison to them you made the same product but it cost you less.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example: Who has a comparative advantage?

## Example: How to find mutually beneficial terms of trade? (Given PPF Curve)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In the previous slides, we found out that I should specialize in apples and you in bananas but if we were to trade, what's the right mixture of apples and bananas that would benefit both of us?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
We can look at the terms from the perspective of trading 1 apple for ____ bananas or trading 1 banana for ____ apples. Let's solve for both.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<hr/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Terms of Trade: 1 **apple** for ____ bananas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You already have the answer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Look at the numbers. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Me:  **1A = 5B** | 1B = 1/5 A  
You: **1A = 8B** | 1B = 1/8 A

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If your focus is apples then focus on how much you're giving up for 1 apple already without trading.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'm giving up 5 bananas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You are giving up 8 bananas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So for 1 apple we will trade between 5 to 8 bananas non-inclusive (meaning not including 5 or 8).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, 1 apple = [4-7] bananas  (the dash means "to" so, "4 to 7" bananas. It's just a range.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, in a MC question these answers would be correct:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

1 apple for 5 bananas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

1 apple for 6 bananas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<hr/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Terms of Trade: 1 **banana** for ____ apples.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Look at the numbers and focus on 1B. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Me:    1A = 5B  | **1B = 1/5 A**  
You:   1A = 8B  | **1B = 1/8 A**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I’m giving up 1/5 (0.2) apples.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You are giving up 1/8 (0.125) apples.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So for 1 banana we will trade between 1/8 (0.125) to 1/5 (0.2) apples non-inclusive (meaning not including 1/8 or 1/5).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, 1 banana = [0.124 - 0.19] apples (Read as: 1 banana equals 0.124 to 0.19 apples.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    
So, in a MC question these answers would be correct:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

1 banana for 0.1244 apples.

1 banana for 0.13 apples.

1 banana for 0.14 apples.

1 banana for 0.15 apples.

1 banana for 0.16 apples.

1 banana for 0.17 apples.

1 banana for 0.18 apples.

1 banana for 0.1899999 apples.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
and alllll those numbers in between.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example: Given Table

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<Table4> </Table4>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Answer the following, 
<li style = "list-style:none">(1) What is the opportunity cost for producing 1 unit of each product? </li>
<li style = "list-style:none">(2) Who has a comparative advantage in apples? That means what? </li>
<li style = "list-style:none">(3) Who has a comparative advantage in bananas? That means what?  </li>
<li style = "list-style:none">(4) What are the mutually beneficial terms of trade? 1 apple for ____ bananas. </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<Table5> </Table5>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li style = "list-style:none">(1) What is the opportunity cost for producing 1 unit of each product? </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The opportunity cost of producing 1 apple for me is 5 bananas. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The opportunity cost of producing 1 apple for you is 8 bananas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The opportunity cost of producing 1 banana for me is 1/5 of an apple. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The opportunity cost of producing 1 banana for you is 1/8 of an apple.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li style = "list-style:none">(2) Who has a comparative advantage in apples? That means what? </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Because I give up less bananas when making 1 apple, I have a comparative advantage in apples over you so that means I should specialize in making apples.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li style = "list-style:none">(3) Who has a comparative advantage in bananas? That means what?  </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Because you give up less apples when making 1 banana, you have a comparative advantage in bananas over me so that means you should specialize in making bananas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li style = "list-style:none">(4) What are the mutually beneficial terms of trade? 1 **apple** for ____ bananas. </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you are given **1 apple** then look at your numbers and focus on the **1A**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Me:    **1A** = 5B  | 1B = 1/5 A  
You:   **1A** = 8B  | 1B = 1/8 A

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Take those numbers 5 and 8 and subtract 1 from both.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Then, 1 apple = [4-7] bananas. (This is read as 1 apple for 4 to 7 bananas.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example: Given Word Problem

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sarai can make 10 bananas or 2 apples. You can make 8 bananas or 1 apple. Find the mutually beneficial terms of trade if they were to trade bananas and apples.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is what a word problem could look like, you still have to do the same work we have been doing to answer the question, you will get the same answer. First step should always set your intercepts equal to eachother.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For me: 10B = 2A  
For you: 8B = 1A 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

From there, it's the same steps as we have been doing.
