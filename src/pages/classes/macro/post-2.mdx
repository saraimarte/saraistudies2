    The three decision making units are 
    <li style = "list-style:none">(1) Households</li>
    <li style = "list-style:none">(2) Firms </li>
    <li style = "list-style:none">(3) Government </li>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    In micro, we looked at the decisions of households and firms and how they affected the economy.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    In macro, we mostly focus on the government and how their decisions affect the economy.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    There are 2 criteria to making optimal decisions,
    <li style = "list-style:none">(1) Having all relevant information.</li>
    <li style = "list-style:none">(2) Having the incentive to act on it. </li>

    Three Fundamental Concepts of Marco Economics

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    # (1) Opportunity Cost

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    The idea is that when we make decisions, we inccur opportunity costs.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    Opportunity Cost = Explicit Costs + Implicit Costs 

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    


    Explicit Costs = costs you have a receipt for

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    Implicit Costs = the cost of the *next best alternative* you're giving up

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    ### Micro Example: What is the opportunity cost of you going to college this semester? 

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    Explicit Costs = tuition + dorm + books 

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    Implicit Costs = the money you *would* have made in a full time job (bc you gave up the opportunity of taking the job because you went to college)

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    ### Macro Example: What is the opportunity cost of the government buying new weapons?

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    Explicit Costs = weapons

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    Implicit Costs = the money they would have spent buying new hospital beds or funding schools, etc. whichever one of these would be the next best alternative.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    # (2) Marginal Analysis

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    Marginal Analysis is all about analyzing the decisions we make on the margin. On the margin just means "a little bit more". 

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    ### Example

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    Let's say we make pizzas.
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    Marginal analysis is where we anaylze the additional costs inccured if we *decide* to make a little bit more pizza-or not.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    # (3) Efficient Markets

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    The idea is that we strive for markets to be efficient, meaning we are not over or under producing. No more no less. We are producing exactly what consumers are demanding. 

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   

    Markets can have both or either

    <li style = "list-style:none">(1) Productive Efficiency</li>
    <li style = "list-style:none">(2) Allocative Efficiency </li>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    But when a market is said to be efficient- they have both.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    ### Allocative Efficiency

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    This is about making the right amount based on consumer's preferences.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    When markets produce at a point that will bring the most value to the consumer while still being fair to the producers. 
  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    When markets produce at a point that will supply goods to the consumers who value those goods the most.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    In other words, when the benefit the consumer recevies from the product is equal to the cost the producers inccured from making the product- that is when the market has allocative efficiency.

    ### Productive Efficiency

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    This is when we make the most of what we have.
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    

    When markets produce at the lowest cost possible *while* maximizing the use of avaliable resources.
   
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    


    They're being productively efficient with their resources.
