An economy grows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We need a way to measure that growth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That way is called GDP.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Gross means total.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Domestic means made in the country.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Product - well, it's the product we produce.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, when they ask you to find GDP, they're asking you to find the total quantity of products produced in the country, BUT it's not just the quantity but the *value* of those quantities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For example, I can ask you how many popsicles you ate. But I can also ask you how much *worth* of popsicles you ate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You can say you ate 3 popsicles. But if each popsicle costs $2, then you ate (Quantity x Price) (3 x $2) = $6 worth of popsicles.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

With GDP, it's the same idea- GDP wants the *value* of total products produced in the country- not just how many products you produced.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, there are two different types of GDP

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) Nominal GDP

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(2) Real GDP

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What's the difference between both?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Real GDP tells us what *really* happened with the total value of products domestically produced from one year to another because it doesn't take into account price inflation- instead, it keeps prices constant.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Nominal GDP is less accurate because it takes into account price inflation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'll prove to you why Real GDP is more accurate:
