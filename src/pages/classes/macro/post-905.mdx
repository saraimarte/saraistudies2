There are two main things you have to know: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li style="list-style:none">(1) The Consumption Function</li>
<li style="list-style:none">(2) The Savings Function </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# The Idea

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

People earn income.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Disposable Income is what you have left over after paying taxes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

After paying taxes- that money is now completely yours to do whatever you want with it. However, you can only  really do two things with this money- consume it (aka spend it) or save it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you earn $500 in disposable income (income after taxes) and you decide to consume $400 then how much did you save? Well, what's left over- $100.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In macro, we look at things not from an individuals perspective but from the nations perspective. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We can find out how much a nation is consuming vs how much they are spending at any level of income if we can find some functions that tell us just that.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# The Consumption Function

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Tells you at how much the nation will consume (C) given a certain level of income (Y).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

C = intercept + slope(Y)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: 
C = <span style = "color:blue"> <b> 200 </b> </span> + <span style = "color:red"><b>0.80</b></span> <span style = "color:green"> <b>Y</b> </span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**<span style = "color:blue">This means that at $0 income, the nation will consume $200 worth of consumption. </span>**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This makes sense because think about the homeless who don't work. They make $0 in income yet they still consume. They have to survive sommehow. They still eat, they shower in shelters etc.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**<span style = "color:red"> People will consume 80% </span> <span style = "color:green"> of their income. </span>**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# The Savings Function

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Tells you at how much the nation will save (S) given a certain level of income (Y).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is literally the opposite of the consumption function. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So if this is my consumption function &nbsp;&nbsp; C = <span style = "color:blue"> <b> 200 </b> </span> + <span style = "color:red"><b>0.80</b></span> <span style = "color:green"> <b>Y</b> </span>  
then this would be my savings function S = <span style = "color:blue"> <b> -200 </b> </span> + <span style = "color:red"><b>0.20</b></span> <span style = "color:green"> <b>Y</b> </span>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Notice how they are opposites. 200 goes to -200. 0.80 goes to "what's left over" that is 0.20.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: 
S = <span style = "color:blue"> <b> -200 </b> </span> + <span style = "color:red"><b>0.20</b></span> <span style = "color:green"> <b>Y</b> </span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**<span style = "color:blue">This means that at $0 income, the nation will save -$200 worth of consumption (so not really saving- the nation is desaving).</span>**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This makes sense because at $0 of income the homeless may be consuming $200 but where are they taking that from? Their savings. So their savings go down by that same amount.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**<span style = "color:red"> People will save 20% </span> <span style = "color:green"> of their income. </span>**
