Previously, I showed you the most applicable form of GDP, where they give you the numbers in quantities and their prices, but sometimes you may see more conceptual questions where they give you categories, and you have to calculate GDP from that. So, you have to know what kinds of products go into GDP.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

GDP = C + I + G + Xn

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<hr/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Included in GDP

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


C = Consumer Goods (Durable goods/Nondurable goods/Services)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I = Investments/ Gross Private Domestic Investment (capital/equipment/non and residential structures/inventory levels)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

C = Government Purchases (Federal Spending/Local Spending)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Xn = **n**et e**X**ports. (Exports-Imports)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<hr/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Excluded in GDP

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) Secondhand Sales (thrift shops, craigslist, eBay)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(2) Financial Transactions (Stock, Bonds, transfer payments)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(3) Intermediate Goods (goods that are used in the process of making the final good. For example, if you make a car, the intermediate good would be a tire. You don't count the cost of that tire in GDP because it will eventually be counted when you count the car's total value).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Don't bother memorizing- practice, and you'll remember naturally. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Before you start practicing, there's one more thing you should know- there are 2 special ways to calculate net investment:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) The formula: Net Investment = Gross Investment - Depreciation
(2) Using Beginning and Ending Capital Stock: Ce = Cb + Net Investment 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) Value of stuff that's left over = total value of new stuff - depreciation of that stuff

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(2) Capital Stock is the same thing as Net Investment. It includes physical equipment, factories, houses, and inventory. The only difference is that Capital stock represents existing physical equipment, factories, etc., while Net investment represents the new and final equipment,  factories, etc. So we don't include capital stock in GDP because GDP represents the value of all final goods, not existing goods. Yet, we can use capital stock to find Net Investment with this simple formula;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ce = Cb + Net Invetment 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Think of it like this, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Stuff at the end of the year = stuff at the beginning of the year + new stuff

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, if I give you Ce and Cb- you can calculate net investment. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
