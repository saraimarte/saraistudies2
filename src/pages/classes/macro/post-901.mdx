Labor Force = Unemployed  + Employed

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Unemployed = ppl who are jobless but are **actively** looking for work

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Discouraged Workers = ppl who were unemployed but were discouraged so they are no longer **actively** looking for a job hence not unemployed anymore.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Practice identifying who is in the labor and who is not:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<GameType2 
	 data = {data}
     hint = "In Labor Force = Unemployed or Employed; Unemployed = doesn't have a job but is actively looking for work; Employed = has a job."
	 answer1A = "In Labor Force" answer1B = "Not In Labor Force">
</GameType2>
