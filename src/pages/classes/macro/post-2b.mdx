I think of it this way,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Normative = Opinion  
Positive = Fact

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Normative Economics is viewing economics from a judgemental or opinionated perspective.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: The government *should* fund more schools. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That's an opinion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Positive Economics is way to view economics from an unbiased and purley fact-based perspective.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: Inflation increased by 2%. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That's a fact.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's practice...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<Game data = {gameData} answer1A ="Normative" answer1B = "Positive" hint = "If it sounds like an opinion = Normative. If it sounds like a fact = Positive OR Should = Normative; Would = Positive"> </Game>

</span>
