## Basic Concept

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## From Individual to Market Demand and Supply curves.

## What Causes Movements vs Shifts in the Supply and Demand Curves?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Quantitative Analysis (Given Inverse Demand Functions)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Inverse Demand Functions:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Qs = -2 + (1/2)P 
Qd = 15 - (1/4)P

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Given the previous functions answer the following questions,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li style = "list-style:none"> (A) What is the equilibrium quantity? </li>
<li style = "list-style:none"> (B) What is the equilibrium price? </li>
<li style = "list-style:none"> (C) What is Consumer Surplus? </li>
<li style = "list-style:none"> (D) What is Producer Surplus? </li>
<li style = "list-style:none"> (E) Is there Deadweight loss? If so, what is it? </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<hr/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li style = "list-style:none"> **(A) What is the equilibrium quantity?** </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) Rearrange and solve for P. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Qs = -2 + (1/2)P becomes  P = 2Qs + 4


Qd = 15 - (1/4)P becomes  P = -4Q + 60

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(2) Set both functions *equal* to eachother and solve for Q.  
Note: Because we are finding equilibirum quantity, remember that means Qd = Qs so in this case they will be the same or *equal* to eachother so we can replace Qd and Qs with just Q.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

2Q + 4 = -4Q + 60
6Q = 56 
Q = 28/3 = (9.33)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Our equilibirum quantity is 9.33 units.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<hr/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li style = "list-style:none"> **(B) What is the equilibirum price?** </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Just take Q and plug it into one of the equations. I'll plug it into the first equation P = 2Qs + 4. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 P = 22.66  
 P = $22.66

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Our equilibirum price is $22.66.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<hr/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li style = "list-style:none"> (C) **What is Consumer Surplus?** </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The area above the price but below the demand curve. That area is a triangle so the area of a triangle is 1/2 B*H.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The base is just always going to be the equilibirum quantity *only* if the market is at equilibrium. In this case the B = 9.33.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The height is the distance from the equilibrium price to the intersection point of the demand curve in the y-axis (when P = 0).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) So plug in **P = 0**;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Qd = 15 - (1/4)**P**   
Qd = 15 - (1/4)**0**  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Qd = 15 - 0
Qd = 15 when p=0

(3) Plug into formula

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

CS = (1/2) * (B) * (H)  
CS = (1/2) * (9.33) * (15) = 69.975

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Our Consumer Surplus is $960.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<hr/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li style = "list-style:none"> (D) **What is Producer Surplus?** </li>

Producer Surplus is just like CS - it's the area of a triangle but this time the height is from the price to where the supply curve intersects the y-axis (when Qs = 0)

Qs = -2 + (1/2)P  
0 = -2 + (1/2)P
2 = (1/2)P
4 = P
