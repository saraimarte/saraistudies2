In an economy, prices sometimes go up throughout the years.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That is called inflation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

How do we measure inflation?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

By using the inflation rate formula.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

NOO!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                N      O     O ! Get it?            
Inflation Rate = **N**ew - **O**ld / **O**ld 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But what's new and what's old? And- what's 'what'?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, you can use two 'whats' to measure the inflation rate: 

(1) GDP Deflator OR 
(2) CPI Index

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As for what makes them new or old, it depends on the year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What's the difference between using the GDP Deflator or the CPI Index?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I think of it like this -

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you've ever taken a stat class- think of GDP Inflation as looking at the **whole population** of goods and keeping track of how much each good increased in price, while CPI takes a **sample of the population** of goods and keeps track of how much each good increased in price.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

SO, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

GDP Deflator - All the goods in the economy 
CPI Index -    basket of goods (specifically consumer goods) 
 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example: Using GDP Deflator to Measure Inflation Rate

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


## Example: Using CPI Index to Measure Inflation Rate


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: You can find the GDP deflator given CPI data, but it's not guaranteed you will find the CPI index using GDP deflator data. Why? In order to find the CPI index, the quantity of goods produced throughout the year needs to stay fixed.
