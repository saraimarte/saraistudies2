# Redirecting and Piping

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Redirecting to a file

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    java fileName1 > data.txt


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is saying, "Hey, I want to store the output of this program in**to** data.txt"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Redirecting from a file

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    java fileName2 < data.txt


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is saying, "Hey, I want to use info from data.txt in**to** my program."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

OR

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is saying, "Hey, I want to use the output of the program into fileName1 in this program
fileName2"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

With piping you can do this in one go

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    java fileName1 | fileName2


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is saying, "Hey, I want to use the output from fileName1 as input in fileName2."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## What is the difference between redirecting and piping?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You might be like, well if piping can do the same thing and faster why use redirecting?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, we don't. We don't use redirecting for taking output from one file as input to another
because piping can do it faster. We can but we don't.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Instead we use redirecting tools for their specific functionalities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sometimes you don't want to use the output from one file in another, you just simply want to
save the output as data you can look at later. Then you would just use redirecting to a file using,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    fileName1 > data.txt
     
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sometimes, you download a file from the internet and want to use it as input in one of your files
so you would use,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

     fileName1 < fileFromTheInterent.txt
     
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


<details>

  <summary>Another way to think of this </summary>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Step 1: We can take an output from file1 and save it in a text file called output.txt.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Step2: Later we can take that same output.txt file and use it's output as input for another program in file2.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    But we can do this in one go with piping.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Step1: Piping takes the output of file1 straight as the input for file2.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Meaning that with piping we don't have to do 2 steps like we did in redirecting but only one step for when we want to use the output of one file in another.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    So, piping only exists for that case scenario but redirecting can also be used to do the same
    thing, it will just take an extra step.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    However, redirecting doesn't just exist to take output from one file to another. They also exist to
    do each individual part by itself.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Sometimes you don't want to use the output from one file in another, you just simply want to
    save the output as data you can look at later. Then you would just use redirecting to a file using,
    java fileName1 > data.txt.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Sometimes, you download a file from the internet and want to use it as input in one of your files
    so you would use,
    java fileName1 < fileFromTheInterent.txt

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Confused about the arrows?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: Think of the pointy part of > or < as "**to**", so in  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    java fileName1 > data.txt


 ```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The pointy part is pointing **to** data.txt so the data is going in**to** **data.txt**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    java fileName1 < fileFromTheInterent.txt


 ```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

the pointy part is pointing **to** fileName1 meaning the data from fileFromTheInterent is going in**to**
**fileName1**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Possible Errors

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details>

  <summary>
   The < operator is reserved for future use. Error when running java AirParticles < SmallerPM2.5.txt.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    ``` java

        At line:1 char:19
        + java AirParticles < SmallerPM2.5.txt
        +                   ~
        The '<' operator is reserved for future use.
            + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException
            + FullyQualifiedErrorId : RedirectionNotSupported


    ```
   </summary>
  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    You are getting this error probably because you are using VS Code's Terminal. 
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Fact: VSCodes Terminal runs on powershell. 

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    And Powershell does not support ```java java AirParticles < SmallerPM2.5.txt ``` so you have to use the command prompt.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Next to where it says "powershell" in the right corner of the terminal near the 'x' there should be a plus sign and a drop down arrow. Click on the drop down arrow and click "Command Prompt" should be the third option from the top. Now run the same line and it should work,

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    If you're on apple you wouldn't get this error because apple uses zsh (z-shell) not powershell.
