## Primitive vs Abstract Data Types / Objects

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So far we have used primitive data types: int, double, char,  boolean

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

but now we are going to use abstract data types: String, Color, Picture.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Abstract data types are where the client (your computer) can't actually see the representation of your data because it's hidden.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Why is it hidden?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Because anything that is not a primitive type is a reference type. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Meaning that when you create an abstract data type- the computer is creating that object somewhere in the heap. (The heap is just a space in memory where all your objects are stored).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The computer is not able to 'see' the value of the object itself because the <span style = "color:green; font-weight: bold"> variable you set your object equal to </span> only holds the address of where the object is but not the object itself- so the variable *refers* to the object but again, does not hold the object. Hence, the object is hidden from the computer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's take a look at the String object for example.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We are used to declaring and initializing a string like so,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    String name = "name";


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

but what you didn't know is that this is really called a string literal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The simple fact is that when a string literal is defined- that automatically creates an object. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Think of the string literal as a short hand to create an object.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is ONLY true for string literals because the ```String``` object is built into java and...it's an *abstract* object.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details>
  <summary> Why is this only true for objects that are abstract and built into Java? </summary>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Because integer literals, and double literals, and boolean literals exist aswell but that does not mean they automatically create Integer or Double objects when defined. 

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Why?

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Because integers and doubles are not abstract, they are primitive which is why you don't see 

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    ```java 

        Int number = 3;
    

    ```

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    and instead you see

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    ```java 

        int number = 3;


    ```

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    where in the first case, Int has an uppercase I and the second case it doesn't.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Objects that are abstract start with an Uppercase letter. We have never written Int with uppercase meaning it's not an abstract object, in fact, we know it's a primitive object.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    So despite us defining an integer literal- that does not create an object automatically or at all because int is again, not an abstract object (it doesn't start with uppercase I) - it's not a built in abstract object like String.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</details> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

How do I know ```String``` is an abstract object?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Because it starts with a capital letter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Have you ever wondered why ```String``` was the only data type we wrote with an uppercase letter? All the other data types started with lowercase like ```int``` or ```double```. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Again, it's because ```String``` is the only data type/object that is abstract- the rest are primitive and therefore start with lowercase letters.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Which is why we have been writing this, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    String name = "name"; //upercase string = abstract object


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

and not 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    string name = "name"; //lowercase string = not abstract object


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If we were to have the second case where string is not a built in data type/object then,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

1.you would have to create it from scratch or import it as you would Picture and Color (you will learn how to create your own objects in the next lesson)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

*which is why I say string literals automatically create string objects only if the object is already built in because you would *have* to create the String object from scratch if it's not already built in and would *have* to use proper notation to construct that object meaning a literal would not work in the first place.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

and 2. you would have to create a String object with the proper notation as you would any other object.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here is the proper format of constructing a String:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Constructing a String Object

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    String name = new String("name");


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


<span style = "color:blue; font-weight: bold"> String </span>
<span style = "color:green; font-weight: bold"> name </span>
<span style = "color:black; font-weight: bold"> = </span>
<span style = "color:orange; font-weight: bold"> new  </span>
<span style = "color:red; font-weight: bold"> String( </span>
<span style = "color:purple; font-weight: bold"> "name" </span>
<span style = "color:red; font-weight: bold"> ) </span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style = "color:blue; font-weight: bold"> Abstract Data Type/Object</span> - you are telling the computer "hey, I want to create a String"   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style = "color:green; font-weight: bold"> Reference Variable  </span>  - this variable simply just refers to the new object I just created, it is NOT the object iself. It simply holds the address of the object (the object is in this place called the heap). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style = "color:orange; font-weight: bold"> new</span>-  this tells Java to go and create a new object somewhere in the heap

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style = "color:red; font-weight: bold"> Constructor( </span>
<span style = "color:purple; font-weight: bold">Data Value) </span>  -  this is the way you create/construct the object- by literally calling the constructor and inputting the value you want for that object.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

so, we have,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style = "color:blue; font-weight: bold"> Abstract Data Type/Object </span>
<span style = "color:green; font-weight: bold"> Reference Variable </span>
<span style = "color:black; font-weight: bold"> = </span>
<span style = "color:orange; font-weight: bold"> new  </span>
<span style = "color:red; font-weight: bold"> Constructor( </span>
<span style = "color:purple; font-weight: bold">Data Value) </span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## String Methods

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, objects may or may not have methods we can use specifically for that object only.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In this case, the String object has a whole lot of methods which are pretty cool because they open a whole world of new things we can do.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: all methods end with () at the end. Ex. .length()

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### 1. String.length()

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Outputs how many letters the string contains.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    String name = new String("name");
    StdOut.println(name.length());

    //Output: 4


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### 2. String.toUpperCase()

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Makes all letters in the string uppercase.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 
        
    String name = new String("name");
    StdOut.println(name.toUpperCase());

    //Output: NAME


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### 3. String.toLowercase()

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Makes all letters in the string lowercase.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 
        
    String name = new String("NaMe");
    StdOut.println(name.toUpperCase());

    //Output: name


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### 4. String.charAt()

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Outputs the character or letter at a specified index.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 
        
    String name = new String("name");
    StdOut.println(name.charAt(0)); //outputs the first letter

    //Output: n


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
