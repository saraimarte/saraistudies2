## The Idea

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So in the last lessons we have learned how to work with given class API's like String, Picture or Color.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now we get to create our own.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's start by creating a person object.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For this, make sure your file name is Demo.java. Here is what you should start with:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    public class Demo {
    
        public static void main (String args[]){
             StdOut.println("Hello World");
        }

        //rest of code will go here 
    }


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you open the terminal (CTRL + J) in VSCode and run

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    javac Demo.java


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

click enter and then run

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    java Demo


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

and enter again, you should see "Hello World" as output.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: Make sure you have the StdIn.java and StdOut.java files in the same folder as Demo.java. If not, then StdOut.println() will not work.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Get the files <a href = "https://rutgers.app.box.com/s/jj32x6ibxigrxu5yfyhbpu4xxi8n9c20">here</a> if you're a Rutgers student.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If this does not work then just use regular old System.Out.println();

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Okay, everything I write now can be after or before the main method does not matter but it should be still inside the Demo class.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

First, if we want to create a person object- we have to create a person class.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

     //object = Person

     public static class Person {

     }



``` 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This says "hey! I want to invent a new data type called Person" 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Second, all datatypes or objects have attributes. As a person, you have a name, you have an age, you have an eye color, weight, and even a password to your phone. Those are your attributes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In Java we call those instance variables.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here, we will define some of those variables.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

     //object = Person
     public static class Person { 
        
        //1. attributes of the object
        public String name;
        private int age;

        
     }



``` 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here, we are saying "hey! make sure that all Persons have attributes of name and age"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: there can be public and private attributes- or instance variables. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'm sure nobody cares who can see their name but maybe some people don't want their age out there so they will like it to be private.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Third, we will set default values for these variables because sometimes people don't want to put in their ages in the first place.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


```java


     //object = Person
     public static class Person {
       
      
        //1. attributes of the object
        public String name;
        private int age;

        //2. defaults 
        //this is also called a setter method
        public Person(){
            name = "defaultName";
            age = 0;
        }


     }



``` 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Fourth, you want to tell java that how to construct a new instance/version of the person object.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java


    //object = Person
    public static class Person {
    
        //1. attributes of the object
        public String name;
        private int age;

        //2. defaults 
        //this is also called a setter method
        public Person(){
            name = "defaultName";
            age = 0;
        }


        //3. tells java how to contruct a new person
        //this is called a constructor
        //it should always have the same name as the class
        public Person(String  name, int age){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }


     }




``` 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The constructor tells java how to construct or create a new person.
It tells java, "hey! when you want to create a new person- you need to take in their name and age".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What is ```this```?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This refers to whatever the new person is. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is used because when we make a new person we give that person it's own variable name but since we don't know what those variable names will be and each time we create a person the varaible name will be different- we refer to that variable as ```this```.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, putting it all together, we have: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


```java 


    public class Demo {
    
        public static void main (String args[]){



        }

        //object = Person
        public static class Person {
        
            //1. attributes of the object
            public String name;
            private int age;

            //2. defaults 
            //this is also called a setter method
            public Person(){
                name = "defaultName";
                age = 0;
            }

            //3. tells java how to contruct a new person
            //this is called a constructor
            //it should always have the same name as the class
            public Person(String  name, int age){
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
            }


    }

    }



```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, in the main method, we can create multiple instances of Person like so, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

        
    public static void main (String args[]){

        //create 2 people, give them names and ages
        Person person1 = new Person("sarai", 20);
        Person person2 = new Person("emily", 21);

        StdOut.println(person1.name);
        StdOut.println(person2.name);


    }



```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Notice, we can access the attributes of these Persons by just selecting the person.attribute.
