## Math Library

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Power Function

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Have you ever questioned how to square a number in java?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, you can multiply it by itself...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

   System.out.println(4*4); //same thing as 4^2 = 16


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

but what if you want to cube a number? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, you can multiply it by itself 3 times...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

   System.out.println(4*4*4); //same thing as 4^3 = 64


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But what if you want to raise a number to the 12th power?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Will you multiply that number by itself 12 times?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

   System.out.println(4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 x 4); //same thing as 4^12 = 16777216


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

...yeah no. We don't have all day.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That's why the math library exists!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The library comes with a bunch of pre built functions you can use like the pow function (stands for power).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, using the pow function from the Math library...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

   System.out.println(Math.pow(4, 12)); //same thing as 4^12 = 16777216 but much nicer :)


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: The Math.pow method returns only doubles.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Random Function

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

About:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<li style = "list-style:none"> (1) Generates a random **double** from 0 to 1.</li>
<li style = "list-style:none"> (2) It always includes the first number. </li>
<li style = "list-style:none"> (3) It does not include the last number unless you add a +1.</li>
<li style = "list-style:none"> (4) If you want it to be a number greater than 0 to 1 then just multiply by the last number. </li>
<li style = "list-style:none"> (5) Inclusive = number should be included. Exclusive = number should be excluded. </li>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 1 | Generate a random *integer* between 0 and 1 not including 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

   int randomNum = (int) Math.random() 
   System.out.println(randomNum);


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


### Example 2 | Generate random *integer* between 1 and 10 (both inclusive)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

   int randomNum = (int) (Math.random() * 10 + 1); 
   // OR int randomNum = (int) (Math.random() * 11); 

   System.out.println(randomNum);


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 3 | Generate random *integer* between 0 and 5 (not including 5)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

   int randomNum = (int) (Math.random() * 5 ); 
   System.out.println(randomNum);


```
