Alrighty! We already know how to output things using ```System.out.println()``` but we can take in inputs from a user aswell.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We know that to do this in pseudocode we just use READ but what is the equivalent in Java?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 1| Read in an Integer from a user (and display the integer +1)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

   int age = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You might be asking what does args[0] mean?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, let's look at the whole thing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    public class fileName {

        public static void Main (String[] args){

            int age = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        }

    }


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here, I explain what this part ``` (String[] args)``` of the Main method does.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The format is (datatypeofInput1, nameOfInput1)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In this case we are saying that,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

datatypeofInput1 is a String - specifically an array (list) of strings.  
nameOfInput1 is args - which stands for arguments.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We are taking in a bunch of string arguments (or inputs in this case) and putting them into a list called args.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So when we write this, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

   int age = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
   System.out.println(age + 1);


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

we're really saying "hey, take in the first argument/input (argument 0) that we're given, make it into an integer, and then set it equal to a variable called age who's datatype is an integer."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: Remember that in programming we start counting at 0 not at 1!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But how does the user actually input an argument? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Through the command line in the terminal. Open up your terminal CTRL + J. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We compile as usual,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    javac fileName.java


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But this time when running the code, we will need to pass in the first argument.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    java fileName 2


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

and that's it! Once you run it you should get 3 out because we told the program to take in the first input, add 1 to it and display the answer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: If you had not entered 2 then you would get an Index Out of Bounds Error because you did not enter the required amount of values the program expects you to.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 2| Read in and Display a Double from a user 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    double weight = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);
    System.out.println(weight);


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Compile and then run with,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    java fileName 150.2


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

and you should get 150.2 as an output.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 3| Read in 1 integer and 1 double from the user, add them together and output the result.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    int num1 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
    double num2 = Double.parseDouble(args[1]);

    double sum = num1 + num2;

    System.out.println(sum);


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


Compile and then run with,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    java fileName 6 6.2


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

and you should get 12.2 as output!
