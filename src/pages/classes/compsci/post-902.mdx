## Installing the Standard Libraries

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Alrighty, so far we have taken inputs and outputs from the command line but there is another way and that is to use the standard libraries!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The idea is that we have a bunch of libraries that each have a bunch of methods we can use. For example, we can use the StdIn library and use it's readInt method to read in an integer and so on.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You can download them <a href = "https://rutgers.app.box.com/s/jj32x6ibxigrxu5yfyhbpu4xxi8n9c20">here</a> if you are a Rutgers student.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If it's not letting you- make sure you sign up for box through <a href = "https://it.rutgers.edu/box/"> here </a>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Make sure you drop them into the same folder that your file is in. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Taking in an input

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We are used to doing the following, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    int number = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We call that the command line method.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But we can also use the standard In library's method called readInt to read in a number given by the user.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    int number = StdIn.readInt();


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When you run this you might be a bit confused because nothing is happening... but there is something happening. The program is waiting for you to put in a number and click enter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you put in 2 and click enter, nothing is happening because you only told it to read the number.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, use System.out to output the number you just put in.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java
        
    int number = StdIn.readInt(); //tell Java to read and store the number

    System.out.println("You entered: " + number); //print out the number 


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you put 2 again you should get "You entered: 2" back.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: the way we use methods is by calling the standard library ```StdIn``` and telling it which method we want to borrow for a quick second ```.readInt()``` for example. Methods always end with ().

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You can also read in a double, string, or boolean.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    int number = StdIn.readInt();
    double decimal = StdIn.readDouble();
    String stringValue = StdIn.readString();
    boolean stringValue = StdIn.readBoolean();


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


## Providing an Output

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We are used to doing the following, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java
    
    System.out.println(number);


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We call that the command line method.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But we can also use the standard Out library's method called println.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    StdOut.println(number);


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's use it in the example above to print out the number we put in.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    // here's a cool thing you can do
    StdOut.println("Enter a number: "); //ask user to put in a number
    
    int number = StdIn.readInt(); //tell Java to read and store the number

    StdOut.println("The number you put in was " + number); //print the number 


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When you compile and run this it will ask you to put in a number, if you put in 2 and click enter you should get 2 back.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Read in multiple inputs (into an array)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    int[] integers = StdIn.readAllInts(); //read in a bunch of integers and store them in an array called integers
    double[] doubles = StdIn.readAllDoubles();//read in a bunch of doubles and store them in an array called doubles
    String[] strings = StdIn.readAllStrings(); //read in a bunch of strings and store them in an array called strings


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's say you want to take in a bunch of numbers and print out the first of them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    int[] numbers = StdIn.readAllInts();
    StdOut.println("First Number: " + numbers[0]);


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When running this line you need to enter the numbers with spaces in between, click enter and then CTRL + Z (Windows) or CTRL + D (Mac) to tell the computer that you are done inputting numbers and then click enter again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example| Write a program that reads in a stream of integers from the user and stores them in an array. Then, print out the sum of all the integers in the array.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    int[] numbers = StdIn.readAllInts(); //reads and stores all numbers

    int sum =  0; //sets sum to 0

    for (int number = 0; number < numbers.length; number++){ //as long as the number exists in the array, add that number to the sum, move on to the next number
        sum = sum + numbers[number];
    }

    StdOut.println(sum); //print out the sum


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Read in Lines

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    String line = StdIn.readLine(); //reads in a whole line
    StdOut.println(line); //prints that line once you click enter.


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: The enter represents the end of your line. As soon as you click enter, this program will print out exactly what you wrote on that line.
