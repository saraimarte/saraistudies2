Alrighty, before we start with real code we have to do pseudo code!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pseudo code is just a way to tell the computer what to do in english instead of java.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's practice!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:100%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/f6z5TkrTIBZILYOd1t" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/NetflixisaJoke-netflix-iglesias-mr-f6z5TkrTIBZILYOd1t"></a></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 1| Take in two numbers from the user. Output the second number.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    READ num1
    READ num2

    DISPLAY num2


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 2| Set a variable age equal to your age. Add 2 years to it and then subtract 1 year. Display age.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    SET age TO 20.
    ADD 2 TO age
    SUBTRACT 1 FROM age
    DISPLAY age


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 3| Compute an expression so that a variable x is equal to (5 times 2) plus 10

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    COMPUTE x AS 5*2 + 10


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 4| Take two numbers as inputs, add them together and display the sum. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    READ num1
    READ num2

    COMPUTE sum AS num1 + num2

    DISPLAY sum


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: You can't use ```SET sum TO num1 + num2``` because SET can only be assigned a variable or a constant NOT an expression. 
You can do something like ```SET grade TO 5``` because 5 is a constant or you can do 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    SET otherVariable TO 5
    SET grade TO otherVariable


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

because the otherVariable is well, a variable.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


### Example 5|  Display the remainder you get when you divide 10 by 5.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: The % operator can be used to find the remainder. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

50/2 = 25. Here, you get the answer when you divide 50 by 2.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

50 % 2 = 0. Here, you get the remainder when you divide 50 by 2 numbers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    COMPUTE remainder AS 10 % 5
    DISPLAY remainder

    //this should display 0 because 10 divided by 5 is
    //2 with remainder 0


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 6| Create a program that displays if a number is even or odd. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    READ number 
    // If number can be divided by 2 completely (w rmder 0) then 
    IF number % 2 == 0 THEN
    // the number is even so display "even"
        DISPLAY even
    //otherwise the number is odd
    ELSE 
        DISPLAY odd
    ENDIF


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 7|  Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle. Remember to account for erroneous inputs!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    READ base
    READ height

    // If base or height are negative numbers then
    IF base < 0 OR height < 0 THEN
        DISPLAY ERROR
    ELSE  
        COMPUTE area AS base * height 
        DISPLAY area
    ENDIF


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


### Example 8| Write a program to convert a given temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit. Remember to account for erroneous inputs!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Formula: celsius*(9/5) + 32.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: The absolute minimum temperature that can exist in celsius is −273.15 degrees. Anything lower than that is impossible...theoretically.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 
    
    READ degreesInCelsius

    IF degreesInCelsius < −273.15 THEN
        DISPLAY ERROR
    ELSE
        COMPUTE degreesInFahrenheit AS degreesInCelsius * (9/5) + 32
        DISPLAY degreesInFahrenheit
    ENDIF


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


### Example 9| Write an algorithm that displays only the last digit of a four digit number given by the user.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FACT: If you divide a number by 10 it's remainder will always be the last digit of that number. Let's say you divide 635 by 10- your remainder will be 5.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

See: https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/longdivision.php

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 
    
    READ number  // assume it's a 4 digit number
    COMPUTE lastDigit AS number % 10


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



### Example 10| Challenge

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In response to a gas shortage crisis, a local government has implemented a gas rationing system based on the last digit of vehicles' license plate numbers. Create a program that informs drivers whether they can refuel on even or odd-numbered days depending on the last digit of their license plate number.
If their license plate numbers end with an even digit then they can only get gas on even numbered days. Otherwise, then they can get gas on odd numbered days.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Assumptions:

    All license plates are four digits long.   
    License plates contain only numerical digits.  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 
    
    READ licensePlateNumber  

    COMPUTE lastDigit AS licensePlateNumber % 10

    IF lastDigit % 2 == 0 THEN 
        DISPLAY  You can get gas on even numbered days.
    ELSE 
        DISPLAY You can get gas on odd numbered days.
    ENDIF


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mmmmmkay, you're done!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: these same problems will be done with actual java code in post 4.
