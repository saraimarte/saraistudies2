This lesson is all about analyzing the performance of your code based on how much input goes into your code.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We measure performance by measuring efficiency.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Efficiency is a measure of speed and space consumption aka how long something takes to run and how much space it needs to run aka the big O.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Finding the Big O is really just counting operations except you only care about what is signficant as n gets really big aka we don't count constants.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Big(O) is also the worst case of performace.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It's the worst possible time and space a program can take.
