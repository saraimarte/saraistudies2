This lesson is all about analyzing the performance of your code based on how much input goes into your code.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We measure performance by measuring efficiency.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Efficiency is a measure of speed and space consumption aka how long something takes to run and how much space it needs to run.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Fatest to slowest O(n).
