## Installing Java and VS Code

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## The Template

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For now, in java we write everything in between these two curly brackets.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    public static void Main (String[] args){
        everything
    }


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I like to call it the template because it's the same thing you will use for every program you write in java.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The professors do not even bother explaining what all these words like public, static, void, etc. mean until we learn about functions... so i'll do the same.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Besides, knowing the meaning won't actually be of any use to you now.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Print Statements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's write our first program! Print "Hello World!"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    public static void Main (String[] args){
        
        System.Out.println("Hello World!");

    }


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This can be read as we are contacting the **system** and we want it to **print** **out** **"Hello World!".**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The print**ln** stands for print **line**, meaning "Hello World!" will be printed in a new line.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You could have done 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    public static void Main (String[] args){
        
        System.Out.print("Hello World!");

    }


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

and that would just print "Hello World!" on the same line.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here, there is no difference because we're only printing one thing but if we had more things to print we wouldn't want them to be all printed in one line but in differrent ones so we use println.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Okay but you wrote it but nothing is happening. Why? Because you haven't ran it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It's like you thinking you want to say Hello to a person but not actually speaking it. You have to run your mouth to say something no?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What's the equivalent of running your mouth in Java? Literally running your code.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Compiling and Running

Before running we have to complie our code in our terminal. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Click on CTRL + J or CMD + J to open it in VSCode.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    javac fileName.java


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

java**c** -> the c stands for complile

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

then to run the code write,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    java fileName


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

great! now you should see your Hello World!

## For Loops

## While Loops


example 7
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: == is not the same as =. We use =  to set something equal to something else. We use == to compare something to something else.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x = y. Here, we are setting x equal to y.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x == y. Here we are asking if x is the same as y.
