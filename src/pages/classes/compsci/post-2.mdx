Alright! Counting Operations is a skill. To master it- you need to practice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: Refer to the Counting Operations section on the <a href = "https://rutgers.app.box.com/s/6saf32ambqftpwlnp3hds9z86i0yce2e">pseudocode reference sheet</a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This program takes in two numbers and returns their sum.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    READ num1
    READ num2

    COMPUTE sum AS num1 + num2

    DISPLAY sum


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Total Operations: ____  
Minimum Operations: ____    
Maximum Operations: ____   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 2

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This program determines if a number is even or odd.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    READ number 

    IF number % 2 == 0 THEN
        DISPLAY even
    ELSE 
        DISPLAY odd
    ENDIF

    
```

## Example 3

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This program calculates the area of a rectangle.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    READ base
    READ height

    IF base < 0 OR height < 0 THEN
        DISPLAY ERROR
    ELSE  
        COMPUTE area AS base * height 
        DISPLAY area
    ENDIF


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 4

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This program calculates the total cost a customer will pay, factoring in a $10 discount coupon if their purchase amount exceeds $100; otherwise, it provides the original purchase amount.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    READ purchaseAmount

    SET couponAmount TO 10  

    IF purchaseAmount > 100 THEN
        COMPUTE totalCost AS purchaseAmount - couponAmount
    ELSE
        SET totalCost TO purchaseAmount
    ENDIF

    DISPLAY totalCost


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Total Operations: ____  
Minimum Operations: ____    
Maximum Operations: ____   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 5

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This program prints the numbers 1 to 5.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    SET i TO 1

    WHILE i <= 5 
        DISPLAY i
        INCREMENT i BY 1
    ENDWHILE


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Total Operations: ____  
Minimum Operations: ____    
Maximum Operations: ____   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This program tells you when a rocket has launched.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    READ initialCountdown

    SET countdown TO initialCountdown

    WHILE countdown > 0 
        DISPLAY "Countdown: " + countdown
        COMPUTE countdown AS countdown - 1
    ENDWHILE
    
    DISPLAY "Rocket Launched!"


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Total Operations: ____  
Minimum Operations: ____    
Maximum Operations: ____   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



## Example 7

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This program helps a college student count down the days until the next break, updating them on the days left every morning.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    READ daysUntilBreak

    WHILE daysUntilBreak > 0 
        DISPLAY "Days until break: " + daysUntilBreak
        COMPUTE daysUntilBreak AS daysUntilBreak - 1
    ENDWHILE

    DISPLAY "Break time! Enjoy your break!"


```

Minimum Operations: ____    
Maximum Operations: ____   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example 8

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This program calculates a student's letter grade by considering both exam score and participation points. It validates the input and assigns a letter grade based on specific conditions, ensuring accurate grading.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

   READ examScore
   READ participationPoints

   IF examScore < 0 OR examScore > 100 OR participationPoints < 0 OR participationPoints > 10 THEN
     DISPLAY Please enter valid scores.
   ELSE
     IF examScore >= 90 AND participationPoints >= 5 THEN
       SET letterGrade TO "A"
     ELSE IF examScore >= 80 AND participationPoints >= 3 THEN
       SET letterGrade TO "B"
     ELSE IF examScore >= 70 AND participationPoints >= 2 THEN
       SET letterGrade TO "C"
     ELSE
       SET letterGrade TO "F"
     ENDIF
     DISPLAY "Letter Grade: " + letterGrade
   ENDIF


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


## Example 9

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This program keeps track of a cleaner's money earned. The money they earn depends on each task they complete.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    SET moneyEarned TO 0

    READ cleanRoom
    READ washDishes
    READ takeOutTrash
    READ cleanBathroom
    READ vacuumFloor

    IF cleanRoom IS true THEN
        ADD 20 TO moneyEarned
    ENDIF

    IF washDishes IS true THEN
        ADD 15 TO moneyEarned 
    ENDIF

    IF takeOutTrash IS true THEN
        ADD 5 TO moneyEarned
    ENDIF

    IF cleanBathroom IS true THEN
        ADD 30 TO moneyEarned
    ENDIF

    IF vacuumFloor IS true THEN
        ADD 20 TO moneyEarned
    ENDIF


```

Total Operations: ____  
Minimum Operations: ____    
Maximum Operations: ____   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


## Example 10

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This program calculates the total cost of purchasing items from a grocery store, with predefined prices for each item. 
Assuming all inputs are positive integers including 0.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    SET totalCost TO 0

    READ applesQuantity
    READ bananasQuantity
    READ orangesQuantity
    READ tomatoesQuantity
    READ cucumbersQuantity

    IF applesQuantity > 0 THEN
        ADD 2 * applesQuantity TO totalCost
    ENDIF

    IF bananasQuantity > 0 THEN
        ADD 1.5 * bananasQuantity TO totalCost
    ENDIF

    IF orangesQuantity > 0 THEN
        ADD 2.5 * orangesQuantity TO totalCost
    ENDIF

    IF tomatoesQuantity > 0 THEN
        ADD 3 * tomatoesQuantity TO totalCost
    ENDIF

    IF cucumbersQuantity > 0 THEN
        ADD 1 * cucumbersQuantity TO totalCost
    ENDIF

    DISPLAY totalCost


```
