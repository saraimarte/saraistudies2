## If Statements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We are familiar with if statements from pseudocode but how do they look like in Java?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Example 1| Create a program that displays if an inputted number is even or odd.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: We assume this number will be an integer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Hint: We use our input skills we learned in the last post! 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 ```java

    //take in number from user
    int number = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

    //see if number is even
    if (number % 2 == 0) {
    // if it's even then print out that the number is even
      System.out.println("Number is even!");
    } else { //otherwise print out the number is false
      System.out.println("Number is odd!");
    }


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Compile and then run with,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    java fileName 4


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

the output should be "Number is even!" because 4 is even.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Also, note that we used == instead of = on ```(number % 2 == 0)```.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Why? Because == is not the same as =.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We use = to set something equal to something else. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We use == to compare something to something else.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x = y. Here, we are setting x equal to y.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x == y. Here we are asking if x is the same as y.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(number % 2 = 0). Here, we are **setting** the remainder when the number is divided by 2 equal to 0. Which doesn't make sense because that it not a comparison.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(number % 2 == 0). Here, we are **asking** if the remainder when the number is divided by 2 is the same as 0.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Nested If Statements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's build a calculator that can only multiply or divide two numbers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The program should take in two numbers from the user and the operation they wish to perform (* or /).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Hint: To compare a string to another you use .equals() method instead of ==.  
Ex. ```operator.equals("*")```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java


    int num1 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]); //read in first argument, turn it into an int and store it as num1  
    int num2 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]); //same thing ^ but for second number
    String operation = args[2]; //read in third argument which is already a string

    if (operation.equals("*")){ //if user wants to multiply the numbers then...
      
      int product = num1 * num2; //compute product as the product of the 2 numbers
      System.out.println("Product " + product); //print out the product

    } else if (operation.equals("/")){ //if user wants to divide the numbers then...

        //NESTED IF STATEMENT BELOW
        if (num2 == 0){ //first check if 2nd number is 0, if it is then...

          System.out.println("Error: Dividing by 0 is undefined."); //print out an error bc you can't divide by 0   

        }else { //otherwise 

            int quotient = num1/num2; // compute quotient as the quotient of the 2 numbers
            System.out.println("Quotient: " + Quotient); //print out the quotient

        }

    }


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When the user says they want to divide the two numbers- that is a clear example of a nested if statement, because there is an if statement within another.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Why? Because before dividing we had to do an additional check if the second number was 0 because we can't divide by 0.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Otherwise, we can go on to compute the quotient.




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


## For Loops

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Create a program that prints out all the numbers from 0 to 5. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java 

    for (int count = 0; count < 6; count++) {
      System.out.println(count);
    }

   // 0 1 2 3 4 5


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## While Loops

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Create a program that prints out all the numbers from 0 to 5. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    int count = 0;
    while (count < 6 ) {
      System.out.println(count);
      count = count + 1;
    }

   // 0 1 2 3 4 5 
 
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Notice: we put 6 instead of 5 because remember that we start counting at 0 so we want it to include 5 so we add + 1.
