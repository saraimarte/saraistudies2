&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There are data types and then there are data structures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Data structures are ways we can store or organize our data. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We can organize our data into a list or in Java we call it an array.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You already have worked with an array- actually since the very first day you learned Java.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    public class fileName {

        public static void Main (String[] args){

        }
    }


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As explained previously, in ```(String[] args)``` we are initializing an array called args and declaring it's datatype to be a String. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Meaning the only things that will go into this array are strings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Despite this knowledge, let's start from scratch!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<hr/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Declaring an Array Reference Variable

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We declare an array reference variable using the following format: datatypeofArray[] arrayName;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    int[] numbers; //declaration of numbers which is a reference variable to an array that can only hold integer values
    boolean[] booleans; //declaration of booleans which is a reference variable to an array that can only hold boolean values
    String[] args; //declaration of args -short for arguments- which is a reference variable to an array that hold any String values.
    String[] names; //declaration of names which is a reference variable to an array that hold only String values.
    double[] doubles; //declaration of doubles which is a reference variable to an array that hold only decimals.


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

By reference variable I mean that in ```String[] names``` names is literally a variable. It is not an array yet. It's simply a variable that references to an array once initialized.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Initializing an Array

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    int[] numbers; //declaring array reference variable numbers
    numbers = new int[10]; //initilizing the array numbers to have 10 values in it.
 

```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

By default Java will fill in the arrays with 0's if you don't specify what to fill it with.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, right now, we have an array called numbers filled with 10 0's.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Try using System.Out to see what the values of the array are for yourself.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Did you try it?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, if you did you would have done something like this 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


```java

    int[] numbers; 
    numbers = new int[10]; 
    System.out.println(numbers);


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

and you would have compiled it and ran it and then...get some weird thing like ```[I@7344699f```  maybe?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yeah, so bad news! You can't just print out an array.  In fact, think about what you truly want to print.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do you want to print the array *or* the values *in* the array?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What you really want to print out are those data values.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So what you want to do is go through the array and for each value in the array- print it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o6MblBrdWarJwXLRC" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/thesimpsons-3o6MblBrdWarJwXLRC"></a></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Does that sound like something familiar to you?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Maybe for loops? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yes, for loops.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Iterating through an array

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Iterating is just a fancy way of saying "going through". I'm going to show you how to go through an array using a for-loop and print out each data value.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    int[] numbers;          //declaring array reference variable 
    numbers = new int[10]; //initilizing the array 
    for (int value = 0; value < numbers.length; value ++) {
      System.out.println(numbers[value]);
    }


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```int value = 0```. Here, we are starting with a variable called value and it will be set to 0.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```value < numbers.length```. As long as the value is less than the length of the array...  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```System.out.println(numbers[value]);``` print out that value from the array

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```value ++``` and move on to the next value.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is a loop that will print out all the data values of the array numbers until the current value is not in the array.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For example, the array holds 10 values so if value = 10 that won't work because there is no numbers[10] only up until numbers[9].  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Why? Remember that we start counting at 0 not 1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, the amount of data values or spaces in an array = 10  
The max index of a data value is = 10-1 = 9

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Okay! So if you run and compile that you should see ten 0's!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Declaring, initializing and displaying an array with specific values + Another way to think of looping through arrays.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What if you don't just want a bunch of 0's?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What if you want the array to hold values of 1, 2, 7, 8, 2?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, let's do it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

   int numbers [] = {1, 2, 7, 8, 2};
   
   for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
      System.out.println(numbers[i]);
   }

  ///Output: 1 2 7 8 2


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here, I used i. It's another way to think about it. i stands for index but I like to think of it standing for an ID. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Think about it this way, every Rutgers student has an ID. No Rutgers student has the same ID as another. An ID is unique to you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Similarly, the array- you can think of it as it being Rutgers the university itself-  the array has 10 spaces in this case or in this analogy 10 students.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Each student has their unqiue ID so that admin at Rutgers can easily access studen't information.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's say I want to select student #1. Well, student number 1 has an ID of 0. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Because in the programming world we start counting at 0.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So to select student #1 from Rutgers I would do,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    Rutgers[0] //get me the first student at rutgers


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

but in this case,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```java

    numbers[0] //get me the first number

    //Output: 1


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, in the code above, i represents whatever index or ID we are currently at. As soon as we run out of ID's the loop breaks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Regardless, if you compile and run your code you should get 1 2 7 8 2!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Setting or changing specific array values

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's declare and initialize an array called ```studentAges``` that will hold the ages of 10 students.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


```java

    int[] studentAges = {24, 20, 18, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 22};


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, let's say that we jotted down a few of the student's ages wrong. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The first student is actually 23 not 24.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The fourth student is actually 18 not 17.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The second to last student is actually 22 not 23.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

How can we access those student's ages and change them?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, to change the first student's age we have to access the first student in the array. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Remember, in the programming world we start counting at 0! 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So our first student has an index (or id) of 0.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


```java

    int[] studentAges = {24, 20, 18, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 22};
    
    studentAges[0] = 23; //select first student and set their age equal to 23


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, output the first studen't age to see if it changed!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


```java

    int[] studentAges = {24, 20, 18, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 22};

    studentAges[0] = 23; //select first student and set their age equal to 23

    System.out.println(studentAges[0]); //print first student's age

    //Output: 23


```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You should get 23! Let's change the other student's ages we got wrong.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



```java

    int[] studentAges = {24, 20, 18, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 22};

    studentAges[0] = 23; //select first student and set their age equal to 23

    studentAges[3] = 18; //select fourth student and set their age equal to 18

    studentAges[8] = 22; //method 1 select second to last student and set their age equal to 22
    studentAges[studentAges.length - 2] = 22; // method 2

    System.out.println(studentAges[0]); //print first student's age
    System.out.println(studentAges[3]); //print fourth's student's age
    System.out.println(studentAges[8]); //print second to last student's age
      
    //Output: 23 18 22


```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: Sometimes we will have an array with a lot of values and we don't want to specify which exactly is the second to last one and we can get away without specifying by taking the length of the array and just saying yeah subtract 2 and that should be the second to last value.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The moral of the story when it comes to accessing values from an array is that whatever value you think you want- just subtract 1 from it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you want the first value then you should access the 0th space. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you want the fourth value then you should access the 3rd space and so on.
