# F-Test

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Before, we talked about population means.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, we can talk about population variances.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In other words before we had zStat and tStat, now we have fStat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Two Tail Test (Variances are different)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## One Tail Test (One variance is greater than the other)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# ANOVA Test

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here, we compare more than 2 population means.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

To perform this test you need to know how to calculate SST, SSA, SSW.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Tukey-Kramer Procedure

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you perform an ANOVA test and it tells you that there **is** a mean that is different then you can use the Tuckey-Kramer Procedure to find **which** mean is different.
