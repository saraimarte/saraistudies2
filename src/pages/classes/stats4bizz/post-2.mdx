## From Discrete to Continuous Data

Discrete Data: Number of Students in the classroom  
Continuous Data: Weight

## Properties of a Normal Distribution

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A normal distribution is a continuous distribution that has a symetrical shape.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There are continuous distributions that are *not* symetrically shaped- those are *not* normal distributions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For example, below are all continuous distributions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ImageOutLg img = {img2}/>

Notice that every continuous distribution has a curve that follows the data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Drawing it, helps you see the shape of the distribution better.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Clearly, distribution A is the only one that is symmetrical and therefore we can say that distribution A is a normal distribution or data A is normally distributed while the other distributions are not.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Okay, I know I said that if a cont.dist is symetrical then it's a normal distrution but...that's not always enough to confirm it's truly normal, which is why there are other properties of a normal distribution other than shape.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## 2 Types of Normal distributions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There is the standard normal distribution and then any other normal distribution.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The standard normal distribution has μ = 0 and σ = 1.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A normal distribution that is *not* standard, has other values for μ and σ.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Despite μ and σ, all normal distributions look the same- symmetrical.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For example, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ImageOutLg img = {img4}/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The first distribution is a standard normal distribution because it has μ = 0 and σ = 1.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The second distribution is any other normal distribution because it does not have both μ = 0 and σ = 1. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Also Note: When we draw normal distributions you have to use proper notation to  let the reader know what μ and σ are.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Find Probability

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Recall: every continuous distribution comes with a curve that follows the data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

With this curve we can find the probability at an exact point (PDF Curve) and up until a certain point (CDF Curve). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Unlike intro to stats for business, we only focus on finding the probability up until a certain point meaning we will only use the CDF curve.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Also, unlike intro to stats, where everything was done by hand or by a calculator, here we use excel.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, let's practice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Given z = 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Evaluate Normality 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Does the data follow the normal distribution?
