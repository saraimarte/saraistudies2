# The Quadratic Regression Model

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We have learned to use the linear regression model but it only works best with *linear* data. What if we have quadratic data? Then we use the quadratic model.

**1.** The following is the quadratic regression equation for a sample of n = 24.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ŷ<sub>i</sub> = 4 + 2X<sub>1</sub> + 2.3X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Predict Y for X<sub>1</sub> = 3. 

<Solution>

**Answer: Ŷ = 30.7**

</Solution>

**2.** The following is the quadratic regression equation for a sample of n = 18.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ŷ<sub>i</sub> = 4496.36 + 63.01X<sub>1</sub> -0.88X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Predict Y for X<sub>1</sub> = 90. 

<Solution>

**Answer: Ŷ = 3039.26**

</Solution>

## Hypothesis Test

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If looking at the data is not enough to tell that you should use the quadratic model... you can always test if using the quadratic model sigficantly improves the model/equation.

**1.** The following is the quadratic regression equation for a sample of n = 24.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ŷ<sub>i</sub> = 4 + 2X<sub>1</sub> + 2.3X<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Suppose that the computed t<sub>STAT</sub> test statistic for the quadratic regression coefficient is 1.95. At the 0.05 level of significance, is there evidence that the quadratic model is better than the linear model?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yes or no?

<Solution>

**Answer: No, there is not sufficient evidence that the quadratic effect improves the model.**

</Solution>

Sometimes we will have data that is not linear *or* quadratic so then we can transform some of the data so that it becomes more linear. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Transformations

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Recall that the data we are using needs to satisfy the assumptions: linearity, normality and equal variance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If either of the last two assumptions are violated then we can transform the **y** values either by doing a log or a square root transformation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
