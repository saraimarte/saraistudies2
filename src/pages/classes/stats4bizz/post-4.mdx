## Confidence Interval for [anything]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When we work with sampling distributions we end up sampling let's say the mean multiple times so we end up with a whole bunch of means but what's our true mean?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, we can use confidence intervals to find the interval where we can be [CL]% confident that our parameter - the true mean- lies within.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

CL = Confidence Level (Given)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For example, 

**Parameter:** μ - the true mean (the population mean)  
**Point Estimate:** x̅ - the estimated mean (the sample mean)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In this case let's say we want to be 95% confident.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, in our conclusion we would say, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We are 95% confident that our true mean lies within this interval (lowerBound, upperBound).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But how do we create the interval?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

point estimate ± sampling error

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Confidence Interval for the Sample Mean (σ Known)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

point estimate ± sampling error

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x̅ ± critical value (standard error)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x̅  ± zStar(standard error) Note: zStar because σ is known

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x̅  ± z<sub>α/2</sub>(σ/√n)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

z<sub>α/2</sub> = ABS(NORM.S.INV( α / 2))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

α = 1 - (CL/100)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** A sociologist is interested in studying the ages of residents in a particular city. The population standard deviation is known to be 5 years. A random sample of 40 individuals resulted in a mean age of 35 years. What is the upper bound of a 95% confidence interval for the average age? (Round to 1 decimal place)

<Solution>

**Answer: 36.5**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We know we need this: point estimate ± sampling error

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

n = 40  
x̅ = 35  
σ =	5  
CL (%) = 95   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This means that α = 1 - (95/100) = 0.05.

**2.** A nutritionist is interested in studying the daily calorie intake of children in a specific school. The population standard deviation is known to be 200 calories. A random sample of 60 children resulted in a mean daily calorie intake of 1800 calories. What is the lower bound of a 99% confidence interval for the average daily calorie intake? (Round to 1 decimal place)

<Solution>

**Answer: 1733.5**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**3** A financial analyst is interested in studying the monthly savings of employees in a tech company. The population standard deviation is known to be $300. A random sample of 45 employees resulted in a mean monthly savings of $2,500. What is interval of a 90% confidence interval for the average monthly savings? (Round to 1 decimal place)

<Solution>

**Answer: ( 2426.4 , 2573.6 )**

## Confidence Interval for the Sampling Mean (σ Unknown)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Population Standard Deviation σ is not known so we use the sample standard deviation s instead. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

point estimate ± sampling error

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x̅ ± critical value (standard error)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x̅  ± zStar(standard error) Note: zStar because σ is known

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x̅  ± t<sub>α/2</sub>(s/√n)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

t<sub>α/2</sub> = T.INV.2T( α , df )

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

df = n - 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Given a sample size n = 25, sample mean x̅ = 25, and sample standard deviation s = 10.5, construct a 95% confidence interval estimate for the population mean. (Round to 4 decimal places)

<Solution>

**Answer: ( 67.9658 , 76.6342 )**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**2.** A market researcher is interested in studying the weekly spending habits of customers at a grocery store. A random sample of 31 customers resulted in a mean weekly spending of $250.50, with a sample standard deviation of $45.20. Construct a 95% confidence interval estimate for the average weekly spending of all customers at the grocery store. (Round to 4 decimal places)
