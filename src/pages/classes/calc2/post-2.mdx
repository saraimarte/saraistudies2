One application of integrals is finding the area of the region between two curves from one point to another.

Alrighty, so the acronym I have for you guys is **FITS!**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

F - Formula  
I - Intersection  (gets the bounds)  
T - Top/Bottom?   (finds what is f(x) & g(x))    
S - Solve Integral  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's try it out!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Find the area of the region bounded by y = 2-x<sup>2</sup> and y = -x by integrating with respect to x.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

First, "with respect to x" just means everything needs to be in terms of x, like the bounds and the equations. And they are! So you're good.
