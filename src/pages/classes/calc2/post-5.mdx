When you find arclength you're just finding the length of a curve.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The types of problems you will see will give you a function and you basically have to plug it's derivative into this formula.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img1.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, the hard part is clearly not finding the arc length - it's finding the derivative and doing the algebra after plugging it into the formula.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Also, you might ask why is arc length denoted as *s*? Shouldn't that be for surface area?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I agree with you but that's how these math people decided to denote arc length. Okay, let's move on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1**. Let K be the part of the curve y = x<sup>3/2</sup> between x = 0 and x = 4. Calculate the arclength of K.
