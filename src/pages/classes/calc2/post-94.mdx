## What is a series

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A series is just the sum of a sequence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In other words, you are adding up all the terms in a sequence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Notation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, if a sequence is: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a<sub>n</sub> = ``` {1, 2, 3...} ```  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

To find the series you take the partial sum at every n and dump that into the sequence of partial sums called s<sub>n</sub>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It's called partial sums because you will notice we take the sum one n at a time- partially.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

s<sub>1</sub> = 1 = 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S<sub>n </sub> = ```{1, ...} ```  
s<sub>2</sub> = 1 + 2 = 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  so, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;S<sub>n </sub> = ```{1, 3, ...} ```  
s<sub>3</sub> = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;so, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S<sub>n </sub> = ```{1, 3, 6 ...} ``` 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

then the series is:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; s<sub>n</sub> = ``` {1 + 3 + 6...} ```  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; s<sub>2</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;  s<sub>3</sub>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, if I ask you:**What is S<sub>3</sub>?** You say 6 because (1 + 2 + 3) = 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'm really asking what is the partial sum of a<sub>n</sub> up until n = 3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In sigma notation, I'm really finding:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img2.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## How do we find the sum of the *whole* sequence?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But if the goal is to find the full sum of the sequence a<sub>n</sub> then that's going to take forever. Because a sequence will go on forever and so will I have to sit here and find the partial sums for forever. Imagine if I had to find S<sub>100000</sub>, we don't have all day. So what do we do?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We literally take the sum of the sequence from a starting point to infinity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap: 20px; flex-wrap:wrap" >

So, instead of finding the sum of the sequence from one point to another finite point n, 

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img1.src} alt=""  /> </div>

We can find the sum of the sequence from one point to infinity. 

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img3.src} alt=""  /> </div>

</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

but remember infinity is not a number, so really we are trying to find the sum of the sequence as it approaches infinity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img4.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

which is really,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img25.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

which is the sum of the sequence of partial sums as n gets infinitely bigger aka the series. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, if the sequence of partial sum (S<sub>n</sub>) converges then the series converges (because the series is literally the sum of the sequence of partial sums as n goes to infinity).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This tells us that to find if a series converges we really just need to find if the sequence of partial sums converges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## What do we care about?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As the last lesson, there are only three things we care about, if a series converges, diverges and if it converges what does it converge to?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### How do we know when a series converges or diverges?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

First, we have three special types of series that when we know something about them, we can conclude they converge.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Those are geometric, telescoping and p-series or harmonic series. Those we will go over first.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Second, we will then move onto tests. These tests will tell us if a series converges or not.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### How do we know what a series converges to, if it converges?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We will only be able to find out what a series converges to if we're dealing with telescoping or geometric series (10.2) because either we can find it manually or we have a formula for the sum. After 10.2, we will only be able to tell if the series converges or not.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## 10.2 Telescoping Series

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Just watch the videos in the solution lol.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do the following series converge of diverge? If they converge, what do they converge to?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img19.src} alt=""  /> </div>

<Solution>

**Answer: Converges. 11/10**

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <ImageMd img = {img42}> </ImageMd>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Note on a mistake I made: I wrote S<sub>n</sub> as  ```{S1 + S2 + S3 + ... }``` 
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  when it's really suppose to be  ```{S1, S2, S3, ...}``` 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  so, commas not plus signs because the sequence of partial sums is a sequence not a series. Series means sum (+). Sequence means list (,).

## 10.2 Geometric Series

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Introduction 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jhr5szmUqts?si=Sv2_1Kbl1CaqwdOf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Series where every term contains a common ratio r.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So Σa<sub>n</sub> = ```{2 + 4 + 8   + ...}```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

is really, Σa<sub>n</sub>  = ```{a + ar + ar^2 + ...}```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Most of the time you won't be given the series in just a list with dots ```{...}``` instead it will be given to you in sigma notation or closed form like so,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img22.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's practice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img46.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here, a = 2 r = 2   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

a is the first term of the series (when n = 1, 4/2 = 2)  
r is the second term divided by the first (when n = 2, 16/4 = 4 so 4(2nd term)/2(1st term) = 2)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Just by knowing what r is we can find out if the series converges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Rule: 

If |r| < 1 CON  
If |r| ≥ 1 DIV  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here, because |2| ≥ 1, the series diverges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### How to find the sum of a geometric series?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, if your series happens to converge, you can find what it converges to by using this formula: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img17.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's practice,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img21.src} alt=""  /> </div>

 **Answer: |r| = 1/10 < 1 so the series Converges to 1/9. a = 1/10**

</Solution>

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img23.src} alt=""  /> </div>

<Solution>

 **Answer: |r| = 3/4 < 1 so the series Converges to -27/6. a = -189/64.**

</Solution>

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img36.src} alt=""  /> </div>

<Solution>

 **Answer: r<sub>1</sub> = 5/6, r<sub>2</sub> = 1/3, both < 1, a<sub>1</sub> = 5/6, a<sub>2</sub> = 1/3, sum<sub>1</sub> = 5, sum<sub>2</sub> = 1/2 so 5 - 1/2 = 9/2. So the series Converges to 9/2.**

</Solution>

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img38.src} alt=""  /> </div>

<Solution>

 **Answer: |r| = 1/9 < 1 so the series Converges 9/10. a = 1.**

</Solution>

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img49.src} alt=""  /> </div>

<Solution>

 **Answer: r<sub>1</sub> = 3/7, r<sub>2</sub> = 5/7, both < 1, a<sub>1</sub> = 9/49, a<sub>2</sub> = 25/49 Sum = -41/28. So the series Converges to -41/28.**

</Solution>

<Note>

There is another formula to find the sum of a geometric series.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ImageMd img = {img51} />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It's the exact same as the a/1-r formula.

## 10.2 P-series (Harmonic Series)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If 
<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img24.src} alt=""  /> </div>
 
is true then the series Σa<sub>n</sub> diverges.

</div>

<Alert>

The divergence test does NOT work the opposite way. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We know that if the limit is not 0 then the series diverges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But it does not say that if the limit IS 0 then the series converges. That is not true. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If it's 0 then we don't know anything about the series. We have to try other tests.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Also, if you know a series diverges, you DON'T automatically know that the limit of the sequence is not 0. It only works in one direction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If the limit of the sequnce is not 0 then the series is divergent. It does not say that if the series is divergent then the limit of the sequence is not 0.

</Alert>

Do the following series converge or diverge?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img26.src} alt=""  /> </div>

<Solution>

 **Answer: Diverges by the divergence test. Limit is ∞.**

</Solution>

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img27.src} alt=""  /> </div>

<Solution>

 **Answer: Diverges by the divergence test. Limit is 1.**

</Solution>

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img50.src} alt=""  /> </div>

<Solution>

 **Answer: Diverges by the divergence test. Limit is 1/4.**

</Solution>

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img29.src} alt=""  /> </div>

<Solution>

 **Answer: Divergence Test does not apply because limit is 0. So we try another test, like p-test works here. The series converges by the p-test where p = 1.**

</Solution>

Okay, so now when the series is not a special series like geometric, telescoping, or harmonic *and* the divergence test does not tell you if it diverges, then we have the integral test.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Positive Series

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The following tests only work for series with positive terms only.  

<Note> 

Note for the future: We can make negative series positive, so you *will* be able to use these tests on those series. Yay!

</Note>

## 10.3 Integral Test

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Only works with series with positive terms.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Conditions: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) Positive  
(2) Continuous  
(3) Decreasing

**Rules:**  
 
If L = ∞ DIV so given series will div aswell.  
If L = constant CON so given series will con aswell. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do the following series converge or diverge?

## 10.4 Comparison Tests

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Direct Comparison Test (DCT)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Only works with series with positive terms.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Rules:**  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If a<sub>n</sub> ≤ b<sub>n</sub> and  Σb<sub>n</sub> converges then so will Σa<sub>n</sub> converge.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If a<sub>n</sub> ≤ b<sub>n</sub> and  Σb<sub>n</sub> diverges then so will Σa<sub>n</sub> diverge.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img10.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

where p is pronounced "row" or "ro" (cuz some mathematician said so 5 billion years ago).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


If p = nonzero number then  Σb<sub>n</sub> and Σa<sub>n</sub> will either both converge or both diverge depending on what b<sub>n</sub> does.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If p = 0 and Σb<sub>n</sub> converges then Σa<sub>n</sub> will also converge.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If p = ∞ and Σb<sub>n</sub> diverges then Σa<sub>n</sub> will also diverge.

# Negative Series

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## 10.5 Testing for Absolute Convergence & Using the Absolute Convergence Theorem (ACT)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What happens when we have series that include negative terms?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What tests do we use now to prove convergence if DCT, LCT, Integral and the other tests only work on series that are positive??

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, because mathematicians are lazy they just said "hey! we don't have to work with series with negative terms- we can just put absolute value signs around them and boom! now they're positive series!".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So just like -1 becomes +1 when you put absolute value signs around it, so does a series become positive when you put absolute signs around it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ImageOut img = {img39}> </ImageOut>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Great! Now we went from a negative series to a positive one.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But waitttt, doesn't adding absolute value signs around the given series make it a *different* series?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yes! That's why we call it the ***corresponding* positive series**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You're right! It's not the same as the series you are given.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

By having the corresponding positive series however, we can now use any of the tests that we learned earlier that only work for positive series, like DCT, LCT and Integral.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"""  
Okay great Sarai. We can use the tests we learned on this corsp. positive series.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But how is this helpful?? My professor didn't ask me if the positive corresponding series converges or not, they asked me if the series they *gave* me converges or not.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So how does testing this corresponding positive series tell me anything useful about the series I was given???  

"""

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, there is this tool we use called the **absolute convergence theorem**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It allows us to say that the given series converges absolutely IF the series with absolute value converges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Hence, the given series converges completely, *absolutely*, in every way possible

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

because it converges with *and* without absolute value signs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"Okay, great I can use the absolute value theorem to say that if the corresponding positive series converges, then the given series converges aswell and hence converges absolutely. In other words, it converges completely- both with and without absolute value signs. But how does that actually work Sarai??? What math says that I can say that???"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The idea is that when you add absolute value to something, the worst you can do is make that something bigger. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So the corresponding positive series with absolute value signs is bigger than the given negative series.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If that's true, think about it like this: little kids always listen to the big kids.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So if big kid says "let's go this way" then small kid will listen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Similarly, if the bigger series says "i'm tired let's start slowing down" then the smaller series will listen and follow the same behavior.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What's really happening is that when the corresponding positive series converges, the smaller given negative series will have to converge aswell because it will always be smaller than the bigger series and hence will never be able to surpass the bigger series. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So if the bigger one stops, so must the smaller one stop.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Okay! That is how the absolute convergence theorem works.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

To conclude, note that we are no longer testing if our given series converges, now we're testing if our series converges absolutely. Meaning that you simply just take the positive corresponding series, find out it converges and use the ACT to say that since the corsp. positive series converges so does the given series hence the given series converges absolutely.

### Ratio Test 

<Note> 

Ramblings on how Rutgers Math Introduces Ratio and Root Test

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

From what I have experienced, I noticed that Rutgers introduces the ratio and root test as absolute convergence tests. This might be misleading to some of you - and it was to me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Any test is an absolute convergence test if you are using it on a positive correpsonding series.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Because remember that you only test for absolute convergence, if the given series is negative.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And when you see a negative series, you know to find it's correpsonding positive series so that you're able to use tests in the first place.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You will notice that ratio and root tests have absolute value signs but the tests actually don't come with absolute value signs. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Rutgers and a lot of other people just put them on so they can save a step in their work. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What's the step?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, if you're dealing with positive series, ratio and root test the way they show it to you makes no difference, because if the series is already positive, then the absolute value signs does nothing- it's still the same series.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, if you're dealing with a negative series, the way that makes sense to me, is recognize that it's a negative series, find it's correpsonding positive series by just simply putting absolute value signs around the given series, and then using any test including ratio or root *without* absolute value signs to prove convergence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Why without absolute value signs? Because the whole purpose of the absolute value signs in the ratio and root test is to make the negative series positive, but I already did that by finding the corsp. positive series.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The whole reason they add the absolute value signs is to find the correpsonding positive serires *for* you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So if you use ratio and root the way that Rutgers gives it to you, then you can skip the step of finding the correpsonding positive series of a given negative series because the absolute value signs in the tests do that for you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You just have to keep in mind that you are no longer testing for regular convergence and are now testing for absolute convergence, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

and that if you are dealing with any other negative series and want to use DCT or LCT, you have to remember to find the corresponding positive series. I feel like when using ratio and root, students don't realize they can use DCT and LCT on negative series because they never consciously understand that the only reason they can use ratio and root test on a negative series is *because* of the absolute value signs already in the tests that automatically makes makes the given negative series into it's correpsonding positive series. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So if you want to use DCT and LCT on negative series, you can! Even if they don't have absolute value signs in the tests themselves. You have to manually find the correpsonding positive series and then go from there.

When to use: factorials (n!) and powers of (2^n)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Rule: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Given: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img15.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Rules:**  
If p < 1 CON ABS  
If p > 1 DIV   
If p = 1 or DNE Inconclusive aka try another test 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What con abs or div? Σa<sub>n</sub> (your given series.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do the following series converge absolutely, converge conditionally or diverge?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img14.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Root Test

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When to use: roots!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Same rules as ratio test but 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img34.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do the following series converge absolutely, converge conditionally or diverge?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## 10.6 Alternating Series Test

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Usually, when dealing with negative series, you test for absolute convergence, if the series converges then the given series converges absolutely and then you're done.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, if the corresponding positive series diverges, if the given series is alternating, the given series *may* converge even though the series with asbolute value diverges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That is why we have the Alternating Series Test (AST).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We use it when we are working with negative series and we find that the corresponding positive series diverges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When to tell: when you see (-1) anywhere in your series.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If the corsp. positive series ends up converging with the alternating series test then we say the given series converges conditionally (because the given series did not meet the *condition* of converging with absolute values but it did converge without them.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img35.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details>

  <summary> Solution </summary>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  First, we note that the series is alternating because of the (-1).

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Then, we check for absolute convergence.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  The series with absolute value is 1/n which we know by the p-test where p = 1 < = 1 that the series diverges.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Because it might be an alternating series, even though the series with absolute value does not converge, the series *without* absolute value may or may not converge. We have to check.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  How do we check?

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  By checking the conditions for an alternating series that converges, which are...  

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  1.a<sub>n</sub> ≥ 0 Positive  
  2.a<sub>n</sub> ≤ a<sub>n</sub>  Decreasing  
  3.lim as n → ∞ of a<sub>n</sub> = 0  

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  If all these conditions are met (which they are, check the video for work), we can say that the given series converges conditionally by the alternating series test (AST) (because it literally did not meet the *condition* of converging absolutely but it did meet the condition of converging (converging w/o absolute value symbols).)

## Alternating Series Summation Theorem

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The main question they ask you is to find the smallest possible integer N that satisfies the inequality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** Find the smallest integer N such that 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img40.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

approximates the sum 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img41.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

with an error no greater than 1/100. 

<Solution>
  N = 9
</Solution>
