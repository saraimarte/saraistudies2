## What is a series

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A series is just the sum of a sequence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In other words, you are adding up all the terms in a sequence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Notation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, if a sequence is: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a<sub>n</sub> = ``` {1, 2, 3...} ```  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

To find the series you take the partial sum at every n and dump that into the sequence of partial sums called s<sub>n</sub>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It's called partial sums because you will notice we take the sum one n at a time- partially.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

s<sub>1</sub> = 1 = 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S<sub>n </sub> = ```{1, ...} ```  
s<sub>2</sub> = 1 + 2 = 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  so, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;S<sub>n </sub> = ```{1, 3, ...} ```  
s<sub>3</sub> = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;so, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S<sub>n </sub> = ```{1, 3, 6 ...} ``` 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

then the series is:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; s<sub>n</sub> = ``` {1, 3, 6...} ```  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; s<sub>2</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;  s<sub>3</sub>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, if I ask you: **What is S<sub>3</sub>?** You say 6 because (1 + 2 + 3) = 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'm really asking what is the partial sum of a<sub>n</sub> up until n = 3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In math notation, I'm really finding:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img2.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But if the goal is to find the full sum of the sequnce a<sub>n</sub> then that's going to take forever. Because a sequence will go on for eva eva and so will I have to sit here and find the partial sums for eva eva. Imagine if I had to find S<sub>100000</sub>, we don't have all day. So what do we do?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We literally take the sum of the sequence from a starting point to infinity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "display:flex; gap: 10px; flex-wrap:wrap" >

So, instead of finding the sum of the sequence from one point to another finite point n, 

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img1.src} alt=""  /> </div>

We can find the sum of the sequence from one point to infinity. 

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img3.src} alt=""  /> </div>

</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

but remember infinity is not a number, so really we are trying to find the sum of the sequence as it approaches infinity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img4.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## What do we care about?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As the last lesson, there are only three things we care about, if a series converges, diverges and if it converges what does it converge to?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

- Notation
- sequence to series
- partial sums
- how to compute the sum of the series
- finding the sum telescoping and geometric
- divergence test nth term test
-segway- we can't find the sums of all series but we can find if they con or div

- Integral Test
- comparison tests DCT LCT 
- absolute convergence test ROOT RATIO
- alternating series test
