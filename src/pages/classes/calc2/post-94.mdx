## What is a series

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A series is just the sum of a sequence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In other words, you are adding up all the terms in a sequence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Notation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, if a sequence is: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a<sub>n</sub> = ``` {1, 2, 3...} ```  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

To find the series you take the partial sum at every n and dump that into the sequence of partial sums called s<sub>n</sub>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It's called partial sums because you will notice we take the sum one n at a time- partially.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

s<sub>1</sub> = 1 = 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S<sub>n </sub> = ```{1, ...} ```  
s<sub>2</sub> = 1 + 2 = 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  so, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;S<sub>n </sub> = ```{1, 3, ...} ```  
s<sub>3</sub> = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;so, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S<sub>n </sub> = ```{1, 3, 6 ...} ``` 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

then the series is:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; s<sub>n</sub> = ``` {1 + 3 + 6...} ```  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; s<sub>2</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;  s<sub>3</sub>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, if I ask you: **What is S<sub>3</sub>?** You say 6 because (1 + 2 + 3) = 6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'm really asking what is the partial sum of a<sub>n</sub> up until n = 3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In sigma notation, I'm really finding:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img2.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## How do we find the sum of the *whole* sequence?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But if the goal is to find the full sum of the sequence a<sub>n</sub> then that's going to take forever. Because a sequence will go on forever and so will I have to sit here and find the partial sums for forever. Imagine if I had to find S<sub>100000</sub>, we don't have all day. So what do we do?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We literally take the sum of the sequence from a starting point to infinity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "display:flex; flex-direction:column; gap: 20px; flex-wrap:wrap" >

So, instead of finding the sum of the sequence from one point to another finite point n, 

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img1.src} alt=""  /> </div>

We can find the sum of the sequence from one point to infinity. 

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img3.src} alt=""  /> </div>

</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

but remember infinity is not a number, so really we are trying to find the sum of the sequence as it approaches infinity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img4.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

which is really,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img25.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

which is the sum of the sequence of partial sums as n gets infinitely bigger aka the series. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, if the sequence of partial sum (S<sub>n</sub>) converges then the series converges (because the series is literally the sum of the sequence of partial sums as n goes to infinity).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This tells us that to find if a series converges we really just need to find if the sequence of partial sums converges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## What do we care about?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As the last lesson, there are only three things we care about, if a series converges, diverges and if it converges what does it converge to?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### How do we know when a series converges or diverges?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

First, we have three special types of series that when we know something about them, we can conclude they converge.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Those are geometric, telescoping and p-series or harmonic series. Those we will go over first.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Second, we will then move onto tests. These tests will tell us if a series converges or not.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### How do we know what a series converges to, if it converges?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We will only be able to find out what a series converges to if we're dealing with telescoping or geometric series (10.2) because either we can find it manually or we have a formula for the sum. After 10.2, we will only be able to tell if the series converges or not.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## 10.2 Telescoping Series

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Just watch the videos in the solution lol.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do the following series converge of diverge? If they converge, what do they converge to?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## 10.2 Geometric Series

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Series where every term contains a common ratio r.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So s<sub>n</sub> = ```{2 + 4 + 8   + ...}```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

is really, s<sub>n</sub> = ```{a + ar + ar^2 + ...}```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: most of the time you won't be given the series in just a list with dots ```{...}``` instead it will be given to you in sigma notation or closed form like so,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img22.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here, a = 2 r = 2   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

a is the first term of the series.   
r is the second term divided by the first (4/2 = 2)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Just by knowing what r is we can find out if the series converges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Rule: 

If |r| < 1 CON  
If |r| ≥ 1 DIV  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here, because |2| ≥ 1, the series S<sub>n</sub> diverges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### How to find the sum of a geometric series?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, if your series happens to converge, you can find what it converges to by using this formula: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img17.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For example, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img21.src} alt=""  /> </div>

## 10.2 Divergence Test (nth term test)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "display:flex; justif-content:center;align-items:center; gap: 10px;"> 
If 
<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img24.src} alt=""  /> </div>
 
is true then the series Σa<sub>n</sub> diverges.

</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: It does NOT work the opposite way. Just because a series diverges does not mean the lim as n approaches infinity of the sequence a<sub>n</sub> is something other than 0.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do the following series converge or diverge?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img26.src} alt=""  /> </div>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</details>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Okay, so now when the series is not a special series like geometric, telescoping, or harmonic and the divergence test does not tell you if it diverges, then we have the integral test.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Positive Series

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The following tests only work for series with positive terms only.  
(Note for the future: We can make negative series positive, so you *will* be able to use these tests on those series. Yay!)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## 10.3 Integral Test

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Only works with series with positive terms.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Conditions: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(1) Positive  
(2) Continuous  
(3) Decreasing  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Find, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img18.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Rules:  

If L = ∞ DIV so given series will div aswell.  
If L = constant CON so given series will con aswell. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do the following series converge or diverge?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## 10.4 Comparison Tests

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Direct Comparison Test (DCT)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Only works with series with positive terms.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The rules: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If a<sub>n</sub> ≤ b<sub>n</sub> and  Σb<sub>n</sub> converges then so will Σa<sub>n</sub> converge.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If a<sub>n</sub> ≤ b<sub>n</sub> and  Σb<sub>n</sub> diverges then so will Σa<sub>n</sub> diverge.

where p is pronounced "row" or "ro" (cuz some mathematician said so 5 billion years ago).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


If p = nonzero number then  Σb<sub>n</sub> and Σa<sub>n</sub> will either both converge or both diverge depending on what b<sub>n</sub> does.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If p = 0 and Σb<sub>n</sub> converges then Σa<sub>n</sub> will also converge.

# Negative Series

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## 10.5 Testing for Absolute Convergence & Using the Absolute Convergence Theorem (ACT)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What happens when we have series with negative terms?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, because mathematicians are lazy they just said "hey! we don't have to work with series with negative terms- we can just put absolute value signs around them and boom! now they're positive series!".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So just like -1 becomes +1 when you put absolute value signs around it, so does a series become positive when you put absolute signs around it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ImageMd img = {img39}> </ImageMd>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Great! Now we went from a negative series to a positive one.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But waitttt, doesn't adding absolute value signs around the given series make it a *different* series?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yes! That's why we call it the ***corresponding* positive series**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You're right! It's not the same as the series you are given.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

By having the corresponding positive series however, we can now use any of the tests that we learned earlier that only work for positive series, like DCT, LCT and Integral.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"""  
Okay great Sarai. We can use the tests we learned on this corsp. positive series.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But how is this helpful?? My professor didn't ask me if the positive corresponding series converges or not, they asked me if the series they *gave* me converges or not.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So how does testing this corresponding positive series tell me anything useful about the series I was given???  

"""

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, first, you are no longer testing for convergence of the given series, you're now testing for absolute convergence of the given series.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When you use one of the convergence tests like DCT, and you prove that the positive series converges then you can say by the absolute convergence theorem (ACT) that the given series converges **absolutely**. In other words, the given series converges **completely**, **absolutely**, in every way possible both with **and** without absolute values *just* because you found that the corsp. positive series converges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Whaaaaaaat? How does this work??

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The idea is that when you add absolute value to something, the worst you can do is make that something bigger. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So the corresponding positive series (that has absolute value signs around it) is bigger than the given negative series. The given negative series will always be smaller or equal to the corrsp. positive series.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Then, if the corresponding positive series converges (is being limited to a value) then so will the given series because remember that the given series is smaller or below the corsp. positive series, so if the big series is being limited, and it's bigger or on top of the smaller series then ofcourse the smaller series will eventually be limited too.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Think about it like this: little kids always listen to the big kids.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So if big kid says "let's go this way" then small kid will listen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In other words, if the big series (in this case the corsp. positive series) converges then the smaller series (given negative series) will have to follow the same behavior and converge as well (Think DCT).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

*Similarly, if the big series (the corsp. positive series) says "let's go to infinity!" (diverges) then the smaller series (the given negative series) will have to follow the same behavior and go to infinity and beyond! (diverge).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

*ALERT: The last part is not the absolute convergence theorem, it's just common sense but it's not always true. Sometimes, we will see later, if a series is alternating, then the given series may converge even if the corresponding positive series diverges. Sometimes little kids don't listen when big kids tell them to go do bad things- like flying off to infinity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

To conclude, we are now testing for **absolute convergence** because when we're testing, we are *literally* testing on a **series with absolute value signs** hence when we find that it converges, we can say that ACT implies that the given series itself converges aswell. In the conclusion however, we don't just say the given series converges, we say the given series converges absolutely because we could only find out that it converged if we knew it converged with absolute values.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, for some reason Rutgers calls the ratio and root tests, absolute convergence tests but really any test is an absolute convergence test as long as you're using it on a positive series with absolute values.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I believe they call ratio and root absolute convergence tests because they add absolute values to the tests so technically they have you test for absolute convergence automatically even if the series isn't negative.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ratio and root without absolute value signs are just like DCT, LCT, Integral Test but because it has absoolute value signs even if you use it on an already series positive series given to you- you have to say that the given series converges absolutely if the series with abs. value convergs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Ratio Test 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When to use: factorials (n!) and powers of (2^n)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Rule: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Given: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img15.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If p < 1 CON ABS  
If p > 1 DIV   
If p = 1 or DNE Inconclusive aka try another test 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What con abs or div? Σa<sub>n</sub> (your given series.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do the following series converge absolutely, converge conditionally or diverge?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img14.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<details>

  <summary> Solution </summary>
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</details>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Root Test

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When to use: roots!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Same rules as ratio test but 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img34.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Do the following series converge absolutely, converge conditionally or diverge?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## 10.6 Alternating Series Test

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When to use: when you see (-1) anywhere in your series.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This test is used for alternating series with negative terms that do not converge absolutely.

AKA test for absolute convergence first with ratio, root, integral, DCT or LCT. You are allowed to use the last 4 because when you test for absolute convergence, it means that you are literally putting absolute value on the series, so the once negative termed series become positive hence you can use the last 4 tests that only work on positive series.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If the corresponding positive series converges with one of those tests, then we say the given series converges absolutely (because the given series literally converged only *with* absolute value symbols around it).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

And then by the absolute convergence theorem, if a series converges absolutely that implies the series itself (the given series) converges aswell and then you're done!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Butttt if  the series ends up diverging and we know it's an alternating series, the series itself may or may not converge. We check using the alternating series test (AST).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If it ends up converging with the alternating series test then we say the given series converges conditionally (because the given series did not meet the *condition* of converging with absolute values but it did converge without them.)

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  First, we note that the series is alternating because of the (-1).

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Then, we check for absolute convergence.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  The series with absolute value is 1/n which we know by the p-test where p = 1 < = 1 that the series diverges.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Because it might be an alternating series, even though the series with absolute value does not converge, the series *without* absolute value may or may not converge. We have to check.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  How do we check?

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  By checking the conditions for an alternating series that converges, which are...  

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  1.a<sub>n</sub> ≥ 0 Positive  
  2.a<sub>n</sub> ≤ a<sub>n</sub>  Decreasing  
  3.lim as n → ∞ of a<sub>n</sub> = 0  

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  If all these conditions are met (which they are, check the video for work), we can say that the given series converges conditionally by the alternating series test (AST) (because it literally did not meet the *condition* of converging absolutely but it did meet the condition of converging (converging w/o absolute value symbols).)
