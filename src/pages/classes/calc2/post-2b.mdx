The idea is that when you have a region bounded by two graphs, if you revolve that region around a line- you get what's called a solid of revolution because it's a literal solid generated by revolving a region about any line.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For the next few weeks you will be finding the volume of those solids.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

How do we find the volume??

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, let's pretend for a moment that the solid of revolution that was created was a loaf of bread.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you slice a loaf of bread, that slice is what we call a cross-section.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That slice has area and a bit of thickness. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If we keep slicing, and keep adding up the areas of those slices times their thickness from one point to antother, we will get the volume of the entire loaf of bread.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ImageOut img = {img2}> </ImageOut>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Essentially, for any cross-section, we can find it's area and thickness and add it up and get our volume.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > 
    <img src={img1.src} alt=""  />
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In this lesson, we will work with all type of cross sections from triangles to squares but in the next two lessons we will be focusing on a specific type of cross-section- disks and then shells!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's start!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Find the volume of a solid whose base is the region bounded by the graphs y = √x and y = x/2, whose cross-sections are perpendicular to the x-axis are **isosceles triangles** of height 6.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Find the volume of a solid whose base is the region bounded by the graphs y = √x and y = x/2, whose cross-sections are perpendicular to the x-axis are **semicircles** with diameters running across the base of the solid.
