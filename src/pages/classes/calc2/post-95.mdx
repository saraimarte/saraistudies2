What we know: Infinite series of numbers:  Σ ```{1, 2, 3,...}```.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What's new: Infinite series of powers of x: Σ ```{1x, 2x^2, 3x^4,...}```.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

that's why it's called a...power series :)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## What do we care about?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We care about finding four things:   
(1) Interval of Convergence (IOC)  
(2) Convergence of Bounds  
(3) Radius of Convergence (ROC)  
(4) Center (a)  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

One of the biggest differences between an infinite series and a power series is that an infinite series if it converges, converges to a finite number. A power series converges over an interval. So instead of finding at what specific point does it converge, we find the interval in which is converges.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style={{ objectFit: 'cover', width: '100%', height: '200px' }}>
  <img src={img1.src} alt="" style={{ width: 'auto', height: '100%' }} />
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

You will know when a series is a power series because that is the only time they ask for IOC or ROC.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Treat these as any other series you have been working except the only tests you will be using are root and ratio and the answer will involve an x at the end. Then there's one more extra step after that.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Example

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence for 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style = "object-fit:contain;" > <img src={img2.src} alt=""  /> </div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If it is not a geometric series then you will first have to do ratio or root test.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Test: Root. Why? Because I see a power of n.
