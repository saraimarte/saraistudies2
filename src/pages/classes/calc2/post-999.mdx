The main question they will ask you is to solve for the solutions of an equation but this time there are complex numbers involved.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The following is the order in which I learned complex numbers literally the day before the exam because I was behind lol.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** I watched the first 3 videos on this playlist and did the problems.

**2.** Then, I learned three different ways to express complex equations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**3.** Then, I learned how to find the solutions for any complex equation.
