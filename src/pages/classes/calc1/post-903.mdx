When you're asked what is the absolute extrema, that is just a fancy way of asking what is the absolute max and min of a function.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's look at absolute extrema graphically:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We can now identify the absolute extrema of a function by looking at it's graph but what if we don't have a graph? What if we're only given the function? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

How can we find the absolute extrema of a function without looking at it's graph? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, an interesting fact about absolute max and min is that they are also critical points. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For a point to be a critical point, it has to satisfy two conditions that we can check without using a graph.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If we're given a function, we can check two conditions to determine if a point is a crticial point and then verify whether it's a max or min. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

That way, we can find the absolute max and min using a function.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In the following video, we will go over the conditions of a critical point and the concept of how to vertify if a point is a max or min.
