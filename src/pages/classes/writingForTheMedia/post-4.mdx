**1.** Spell out *all* numbers. Seventy thousand instead of 70,000. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**2.** Use dollars instead of the symbol $, so seventy thousand dollars instead of $70,000.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**3.** NO headline on paper. Go straight into writing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4.** When they have other people talking that's called a sound on tape (SOT). You have to indicate how long that person is talking. If that person is talking for 9 seconds then,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Professor Jacob Bollin [BO-llin] says **(SOT: 0:09) "I went to the park the other day."**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Anything that the reporter isn't saying themselves is bolded- so SOTs are bolded.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**5.** Your paper needs to have 60 inch margins. In google docs it's 4.5. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**6.** You have to add phonetic spelling to names or other things that are hard to pronounce. Like [SA-rye] for Sarai.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**7.** Every sentence is a new paragraph (Max 2 sentences.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**8.** Period does **not** go inside brackets even if they're at the end of a sentence. Don't: [Something.] Do: [Something].

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**9.** End with three hashtags on the center of your text.
