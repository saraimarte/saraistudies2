For all other AP Style Rules for this course: <a href = "https://quizlet.com/927177499/ap-grammar-writing-for-media-flash-cards/?funnelUUID=ec8fd1aa-2e04-4b27-acc6-04b3a6d76e5d">Quizlet</a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For some cheatsheets I found online: <a href = "https://pa50000545.schoolwires.net/cms/lib/PA50000545/Centricity/Domain/223//PR%20Toolkit/AP%20Style%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf">Cheat Sheet 1</a>, <a href = "https://knightpoliticalreporting.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AP-STYLE-TIP-SHEET.pdf"> Cheat Sheet 2</a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For the styles I used the most:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** For your **headline**, only the first letter should be capitalized unless it's a name, company name, town, position, etc.

<Example>

**H**utchinson likely to retain seat after winning North Brunswick primary

</Example>

**2.** For **names**, you first introduce the person by first and last name but after that only use the last name.

<Example>

In the North Brunswick primary council election on June 4, President **Mary Hutchinson** secured 55% of the votes against challenger **Cologero Socio**. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Both **Hutchinson** and **Socio**, Democratic candidates, faced off in a race that continued the trend of recent years, where North Brunswick has not seen any candidates from the opposing party. 

</Example>

**3.** When using **job titles**, you only capitalize the title *before* the name of the person not after.

<Example>

In the North Brunswick primary council election on June 4, **P**resident Mary Hutchinson secured 55% of the votes against challenger Cologero Socio. The **p**resident felt confident in her winning. 

</Example>

**4.** Commas and other **ponctuation** come **before** quotations.

<Example>

"I want to go to the beach<strong>,"</strong> Sarai said.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

OR

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sarai said<strong>, "</strong>I want to go to the beach."

</Example>

**5.** For **numbers** under 10, write them out. For numbers greater than 10, use the numerical notation. But if a number begins a sentence spell it out. 

<Example>

She wanted **two** dogs. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

She wanted **11** dogs. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Thirty** employees got paid time off in Novemeber. 

</Example>

**6.** For **states**, in the **body** of a story the United States has to be abbreviated to U.S.

<Example>

He wanted to go to the **U.S.** on vacation.

</Example>

**7.** For **dates**, we use arabic figures for decades. No apostrophe. We also write dates like **Jan 2, 2024. Not 2nd.**

<Example>

Baby names like "Dorothy" were popular in the **1920s**.

</Example>

**8.** For **times**, we write **5 p.m.,**
