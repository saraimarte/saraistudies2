Styling rules are a little different when writing for the radio:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1.** **Spell out *all* numbers**. Seventy thousand instead of 70,000. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**2.** Use "dollars" instead of the symbol $, so seventy thousand dollars instead of $70,000.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**3.** **NO headline** on paper. Go straight into writing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4.** When they have other people talking that's called a sound on tape **(SOT)**. You have to indicate **how long that person is talking**. If that person is talking for 9 seconds then,  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Professor Jacob Bollin [BO-llin] says **(SOT: 0:09) "I went to the park the other day."**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Anything that the reporter isn't saying themselves is bolded- so SOTs are bolded.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**5.** Your paper needs to have **60 inch margins**. In google docs it's 4.5. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**6.** You have to add **phonetic spelling to names** or other things that are hard to pronounce. Like [SA-rye] for Sarai.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**7.** Every sentence is a new paragraph (Max 2 sentences.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**8.** Period does **not** go inside brackets even if they're at the end of a sentence. Don't: [Something.] Do: [Something].

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**9.** End with three hashtags on the center of your text. **###**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Instructions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Write a 60-second radio news script. Interview at least one source. Think of it like this, you already reported the story, now you are writing a script for the radio announcer to read live on-air.

Savan had us listen to and type out a radio script and answer some questions about it. Here is what I posted. No feedback from Savan. 

<Example>

**Piece 1**

It's happened to nearly all drivers. You're on the road, your headlight or tail light goes out, and you just hope you do not get pulled over and receive a ticket. But here in Suffolk County, the police Department will no longer give out tickets, but vouchers worth up to two-hundred dollars, where you can go to participating repair shops like Engine Tech here in Patchogue and have that light fixed for no charge.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here is County Executive Steve Ballone (SOT: 0:09) “We're working to avoid placement of additional economic burden on people who may already be financially disadvantaged.” The money for this program comes from a grant, a generous donor, and the county partnered up with the Lights On program to have seventy-thousand dollars for the voucher initiative.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Legislator Sam Gonzalez says for some residents, (SOT: 0:08) “I have to make a decision of whether I'm going to get extra food or now I have this situation that I have a light bulb. That's all.” And anyone, no matter what type of car you're driving, can get a voucher, you do not have to prove financial hardship.

Target radio station: 880 WCBS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4A.** The main fact in the lead is: "Here in Suffolk County, the police department will no longer give out tickets, but vouchers worth up to two-hundred dollars to have car lights fixed."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4B.** The basic WHY is: "We're working to avoid placement of additional economic burden on people who may already be financially disadvantaged."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4C.** The quote and attribution are presented as WHO said WHAT.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: "Here is County Executive Steve Ballone... 'We're working to avoid placement of additional economic burden on people who may already be financially disadvantaged.'"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The attribution uses the present tense (says) for Legislator Sam Gonzalez and a simple introduction for Steve Ballone without a verb.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: "Legislator Sam Gonzalez says..."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The set-up to the quote provides context for the quote rather than merely repeating it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: "Legislator Sam Gonzalez says for some residents… 'I have to make a decision of whether I'm going to get extra food or now I have this situation that I have a light bulb. That's all.'"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4D.** I should…

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Start with a clear and attention-grabbing lead that summarizes the main fact.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Provide context before introducing quotes to ensure they add value and understanding.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4E.** The story flows logically and maintains clarity, making it easy for listeners to follow but there was just one unclear part for me and that was the quote from Gonzalez, “now I have this situation that I have a light bulb.” I didn’t quite get what he meant with the light bulb.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Piece 2**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4A.** The main fact in the lead is: "There is an illness going around with symptoms like headache, fever, and gastrointestinal issues, and it’s not COVID."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4B.** The basic WHY is: "Every time those masks come off, people tend to get together. They're eating together, sharing indoor spaces together. That's where viruses spread quite easily."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4C.** The quote and attribution are presented as WHO said WHAT.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: "Stony Brook Medicine doctor Sharon Dachman tells me if you have COVID symptoms, you should use a home test, but there are a lot of other illnesses going around."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The quote and attribution are presented as WHO said WHAT.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: "Stony Brook Medicine doctor Sharon Dachman tells me if you have COVID symptoms, you should use a home test, but there are a lot of other illnesses going around."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The set-up to the quote provides context for the quote rather than merely repeating it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: "She says allergies are also a big problem right now. She tells me the flu shot appears to be working. 'I think the flu shot is really helping keep people who do get flu from being hospitalized.'"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4D.** I should use present tense attributions:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: Use present tense for attributions to make the information feel current and urgent. "She tells me the flu shot appears to be working."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This technique gives the story a sense of immediacy.

**Piece 3**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4A.** The main fact in the lead is: "If you're looking to hire Santa through hireSanta.com, it might be too late already."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4B.** The basic WHY is: "It might become even more expensive as there are fewer Santas around."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4C.** The quote and attribution are presented as WHO said WHAT.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: "Mitch Allen is the founder and head elf at hireSanta.com. 'We're sold out across the country on weekends already, much sooner than we've ever been.'"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The attribution uses the present tense (is).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: "Mitch Allen is the founder and head elf at hireSanta.com."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The set-up to the quote provides context for the quote rather than merely repeating it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Example: "Mitch Allen is the founder and head elf at hireSanta.com. 'We're sold out across the country on weekends already, much sooner than we've ever been. And we're having asking clients that if you want to have Santa come to your home office, be flexible on the dates and times.'"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**4D.** I should start with a strong lead like "If you're looking to hire Santa through hireSanta.com, it might be too late already."
