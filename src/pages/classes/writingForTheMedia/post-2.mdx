# Structure of a news story 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Fonts and styles

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We use Google Docs, *not* Word because you have to share the link to the doc on canvas since Professor Savan grades the pieces by commenting and editing the doc you shared.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Use only Times New Roman 14 pt., or Bookman Old Style 14 pt. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Savan prefers the **background** of your doc to be **gray**- it's easier for her eyes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In news writing, we **don't do citations** or footnotes like you have been doing all your life for your english classes. Here, we just **do direct links**. You have a fact? Then just link to the site that proves that fact. That's it.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We also **don't do paragraphs** or indentation. Every 'paragraph'/line should just be 1-2 sentences. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We also use the **inverted pyramid structure**- the structure of your content where important stuff comes first like the 5Ws & How's, quotes and then details mentioned later. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The last major part of writing a news story is the style of writing. Here, we use **AP style**. I have a whole list of things you should watch out for in post 2 so check that out.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Basic terms

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Byline:** name of journalist who wrote the piece.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Graph:** fancy way of saying paragraph.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Nut graf:** second, third or fourth graf. It provides context, the larger picture, establishes why the piece is important and newsworthy.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Headline:** Title of your piece.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Lead:** The first sentence of the piece that summarizes the 5Ws & How. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**TK:** Is a placeholder for information that is not yet known. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Slug:** It's just a format for the title of your doc like so, SU24/Name of Assignment/ Your First and Last Name. Ex. SU24/News Report/Sarai Marte

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

*SU24 stands for summer of 2024 since I took this class then. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# The 5 Ws & How

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These are things you need to address in the lead of a story. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**1. What** is the news?  
**2. Who** is the news about?  
**3. When** did the events happen?  
**4. Where** did the events happen?  
**5. Why** did this happen?  
**6. How** did this happen?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# TIPCUP

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When writing a news piece- you need to determine if your story is news worthy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What is the news worthiness of your piece? Use **TIPCUP**. Your story can either be...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

**T**imely - the story is **new** aka worthy of being **new**s  
**I**mpactful - the story impacts a lot of people    
**P**rominent- the story involves anybody well known like the Queen or Taylor Swift   
**C**onflicting - the story involves conflict    
**U**nusual- the story is unsusal     
**P**roximate - the story is about an event that happened nearby      

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Instructions 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Write a 350- to 400-word news story as if you were hired to write it for a local news website (e.g., Patch, TAPinto, NJ.com) on any newsworthy topic. Gather research from primary sources and conduct your own interviews.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Discussion Post (Score 100%)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Savan had us come up with 2 ideas for the piece. Here is what I posted. In red, is her feedback. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Idea 1: A building owned by the Kaplans in North Brunswick, New Jersey had not been billed for their water usage for more than 2 years. The people in charge of the water utility bills were unresponsive for that amount of time which is interesting because how can they not know they weren't billing a building for more than 2 years? I would most likely interview the North Brunswick Utility Directors and ask what really went on in terms of management failure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Idea 2: North Brunswick will soon hold their election on June 4th. I could interview the residents of North Brunswick to get a sense of who the people are leaning towards voting for.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sarai,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

On #1, I have the same comments as I had for [named removed] also thinking of doing this story: I lean toward you doing it, because it's intriguing and different. But I don't understand the implication: that the water company is somehow in kahoots with the building owners, giving them a free ride? Why would they do that? If you do this piece, you'll need to clearly and fairly explain what's going on, as well as provide context and clear sense of the math and money involved. And who are the Kaplans? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For #2, June is Tuesday. So your story would have to be a bit of a follow-up: Who won, who lost, why (as best as you could tell), what are the issues and controversies involved? Who, if anyone, were the incumbents? Aim to talk to someone who ran, whether they lost or won, as well as people voting for or against them. What was the turn out?
